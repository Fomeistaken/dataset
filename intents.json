When I looked down , I was nervous even more.If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to bake meat . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or <MASK> .

Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ' s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .",

          " Yup , you got it . Criminals in America do a lot better if they're white-collar thieves .",
          " He's giving lectures on business at colleges .",

          " Why ? I never saw you eat so much before .",
          " So your stomach is the one that actually gets a lot of work-out .",
          " This way you'll probably put on more weight . Will you give up ?",
          " Then how are you gonna deal with the problem of getting extra weight ?",
          " Oh , I've got an idea . Why don't you ask Dad to go with you ? He badly needs some exercise .",
          " He can just say , I'm Benjamin . I'm new and shy .",
          " Who knows !",
          "You like Titanic ? That movie is so cheesy .",
          " Really ? Well the special effects might have been good in 1997 , but when you watch it today they make the film seem really cheesy .",
          " Actually , I have to admit that you're right . I like some pretty cheesy movies too . I love Arnold Schwarzenegger action flicks , especially \" Terminator . \"",
          " Well ... I saw it only once , but for <MASK> when I talked to people , I pretended I was the Terminator .",

          "Do you have a copy of today ' s newspaper ? I want to check the results from the world athletics championship .",
          " Yes , we won the men ' s 110 metres hurdles . I watched that on TV . What other events did we win ?",
          " That ' s great . Those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition . They must be terribly disappointed if they don ' t win .",
          " That ' s amazing ! Were any other records broken ?",
          " Did you see the final of the men ' s 100 metres ? It was very exciting . One competitor made two false starts .",
          " Yes , he was . I imagine he must be very angry with himself for that .",

          " Sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ' t really appeal to me .",
          " All I know about soccer is that you can ' t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me !",
          "Oh , what a beautiful garden !",
          " The garden looks lovely when the roses are in bloom . You must have a lot of pleasure in planting flowers .",

          " I just want a private conversation with one other person .",
          " Well , maybe I'll tag along and watch how you talk .",
          " It ' s that popular ?",
          "Were you born in the U . S . , Melissa ?",

          "Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?",
          " Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .",
          " That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ' s eight time zones east of Greenwich !",

Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in <MASK> were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year .

It is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing .",

The part that was not dried properly , most probably , escaped their attention .

If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for <MASK> , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ' t default on a payment !",

          " Daddy , do you think we're gonna catch any fish today ? We've been fishing here for <MASK> , and we get nothing .",
          " I love sashimi . Did mom bring any soy sauce for that ?",
          " Cool . Hey , I've got an idea . Why don't we cook it separately ? Half for sashimi , and the other half for grill .",
          " Well , all right . There is nothing to complain about .",

          " Then I ' ll come to your place later in the evening , and how late is your shop open ?",
          "Don't take too much off . I'm trying to grow my hair longer .",
          " That sounds perfect . Do you think I can get some highlights today , too ? I've always wanted red .",
          " All right . I'll just have the cut and perm today .",
          " OK .",

          " I smoke around 30 each day .",
          " If I do a few exercises at home , like crunches , I'll soon deal with this waistline .",
          " I'll join a fitness centre . I'm sure they'll be able to give me more advice . There's one near my office , so I can go before and after work . I don't want to go jogging in the street , so I'll use a treadmill .",
          "The bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ?",
          " So , let ' s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ' Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ' t they ?",

          " Well , it's all new stock in the window now .",
          " Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing .",
          " Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price .",
          " That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it ' s exactly what you are looking for .",

          " Yeah , I have a little one myself . Anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ' t shutting off properly .

          " No . But she taught me last term . How long have you been here ?",
          " Wow , not long . Where do you live ? With a family ?",
          " Yes . Actually my friend has a spare room in here apartment and she's looking for a flatmate . Would you like her phone number ?",
          "What can I help you with ?",
          " What's your question ?",
          " What do you need to take it for ?",
          " You need six hours .",
          " You have to do it in <MASK> .",
          " That's everything .",
          "Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ?",
          " I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays .",
          " Come on , Han Maimed , don ' t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .",
          " Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .",
          " That ' s a little complicated . You ' ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ' s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .",
          " Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .",
          " Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .",
          " That ' s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .",
          " Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College .",
          " Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .",
          " Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name .",
          " In <MASK> , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman .",
          " Therefore , it ' s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard .",
          " Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S .",
          " Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .",
          " You can ask me any question at any time .",
          "Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at the university here ?",
          " It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing .",
          " Yes , I am . I am from Taiwan . I came here to study political science .",
          " I like it so far . But my English still needs work .",
          " Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters ?",
          " I see . I'm from Taiwan , so I know regular characters better than simplified .",
          " Yes , that's true . Especially my writing . I think my papers aren't good enough . I make too many grammatical mistakes .",
          " You mean you and I ?",
          " That sounds like a good idea . How often would you like to do it ?",
          " How would we manage it though ? How would we spend the 90 minutes ?",
          " Would I help you with writing ?",
          " I think it sounds like a good system . But when is it convenient to meet ?",
          " Me too . In fact , I'm free until 1",
          " It sounds good . I will bring the papers I'm working on .",
          " Let me give you my phone number .",
          "What is this eviction notice for ?",
          " Are you kidding me ?",
          " You can ' t just throw me out on the street !",
          " Will you still throw me out if I make the rent payment ?",
          " I am going to take care of the rent payment right now .",
          "Are these your text books ? Biochemistry , General Ecology , Botany , Cell Genetics , Molecular Genetics ...",
          " Oh , right ! Do you have many exams at the end of each semester ?",
          " And when do you prepare for your final exam ?",
          " Really ? You only review your lessons in <MASK> ? Does it work ?",
          " Wow , and all the key points are included in them ? You're so smart !",
          " Do you have the classrooms open for the whole night ?",
          "Hello , I would like to make an appointment to look at houses .",
          " I would prefer mornings .",
          " Going to look at houses during the week is best for me .",
          " I will meet you at the real estate office .",
          " That sounds good to me .",
          "I need to get some business cards printed up .",
          " I think I can get by with 2,000 .",
          " I hope you can make the new cards just like my old cards .",
          " ... Okay , I'm through . Here's the form and my old card .",
          " Now that I think of it , <MASK> is better than seven .",
          "Finally the class is over . Be quick . Ben must have been waiting for long .",
          " That's normal . You have been sitting for three hours , with your attention highly concentrated .",
          " No . You are just burning yourself out these days . Have a good rest and you will feel energetic again .",
          " How could he make such a silly mistake ?",
          " He lost a very good chance to go to college , didn't he ?",
          " That's a very good lesson . We must familiarize ourselves with the exam from now on .",
          "Hello . I would like to buy some business cards .",
          " Two thousand would be fine .",
          " All I want is the same thing on this card .",
          " ... Okay , I'm finished . Here's your form and my old card .",
          " Do you think you could finish it in <MASK> ?",
          "What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense .",
          " Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ?",
          " But , you were born and raised in California !",
          " What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ?",
          " So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ?",
          " Are you sure he really got the message ?",
          " That's hilarious ! What did he say ?",
          " I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again .",
          "you look better today . How did your test go ?",
          " did you pass ?",
          " you should be . You worked really hard last night preparing for it .",
          " you don't have to thank me . It's just a part of my job as your counsellor .",
          " no , in fact , I was terrible at taking exams .",
          " sure , but my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that I could and that helped me a lot . When are your final exams ?",
          " when do you plan on studying for those exams ?",
          " do you think that's a good idea ?",
          " that sounds like a good idea . What are you going to do if you have any questions while you're studying ?",
          " it sounds like you've learned something useful this year !",
          "Tom , you're my good friend , right ?",
          " The exam ! The terrible exam ! I'm not ready yet . Can you tell me how to get good marks ?",
          " Yes , thank you .",
          "hey , Maris , are you a part-timer ?",
          " oh , it ' s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ?",
          " cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar !",
          " that ' s true . I ' m wondering did you learn anything from the job ?",
          " you mean you got working experience , right ?",
          " it must be very demanding .",
          " really ? It sounds interesting .",
          " great . I ' m looking forward to it .",
          "Why do you want to go to the U . S . ?",
          " What will you do when you come home ?",
          " Do you feel your English is good enough for the course ?",
          " Who will be your supporter during your stay in the States ?",
          " How long do you expect to stay there ?",
          "Hello , Kate ! How are you doing ?",
          " Fine . How are your term papers ?",
          " How could it be ? They are due <MASK> .",
          " Kate , you know , I am thinking of getting a part-time job next year because I really need more money and I don't want to ask my parents for any more . But I'm so busy ! How am I going to work and study ? How do you do it ? Do you have some good tips on budgeting time ?",
          " My advisor ?",
          "Guess what came in the mail today ?",
          " My acceptance letter to Yale !",
          " Freshman orientation is the last week of august , but I want to go <MASK> before that to get settled in .",
          " Yes . I ' ll be very busy ! I have to get a visa , buy a plane ticket , and pack my things . But first , I want to register for classes .",
          " Well , they sent me their prospectus , so I can start looking now . do you want to help me decide which classed to take ?",
          " Well , I have to take all the fundamental course , plus a few from my major .",
          " I hope to major in English literature , but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year , so we ' ll see .",
          " In order to graduate , every student must take a certain amount of classes in history , math , English , philosophy , science and art .",
          " Yes , it is . It ' s also very different from the British education system .",
          " oh , sure . In British , students don ' t have to take the foundation course .",
          " maybe because they think they know everything already ! ha ha .",
          "I ' m tired , Larry . Can we have a break ?",
          " I know , but I ' m really tired . My stomach feels funny .",
          " I was too excited to sleep last night . I didn ' t go to sleep until quite late .",
          " About 2 o ' clock in the morning .",
          " About 2 o ' clock .",
          " You did , but I can ' t help it .",
          " Which one do I choose ? I don ' t want to give up , but I really feel tired .",
          " Let me think about it . What should I do ? I think I will not give up .",
          "Excuse me , Miss .",
          " I'm a graduate student here in mathematics . I've just come from China and I've never used a western library before . I'll be here for <MASK> , so I'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . I wonder if someone might have time to show me around .",
          " Sure . 3 thirty this afternoon .",
          " Thank you . Good-bye .",
          "I can't wait until my car is repaired . The commuting with public transportation is killing me .",
          " But it is ! Take this morning for example . The subway was so packed this morning , I got totally squished by about a hundred busy commuters on the way to work .",
          " That's true . The bus is even worse . Just thinking about taking the bus every day makes me tired ! Hey , how do you get to work every day ?",
          " I'll bet it's good exercise , too ... a good way to keep fit .",
          "What are you studying all day long for ? It ' s summer vacation !",
          " Why ?",
          " Do you think it will help ?",
          " Hmm ... Maybe I should sign up too .",
          "Did you go to the bank to withdraw money ?",
          " So you didn ' t . Is that right ?",
          " Why didn ' t you just answer my question directly ? Why would Chinese answer questions this way ? I simply asked if you did it or not . It ' s a very simple question . And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer .",
          " You know , today I asked a student if he brought his dictionary with him . It ' s a rule I made for the class that everyone brings a bilingual dictionary with them because sometimes they don ' t understand me . The funniest thing is that this student gave me a lot of reasons and no direct answer .",
          " Yeah , after all the explanations like , it ' s too heavy , I was in a hurry ... whatever .",
          "This is our first day of class.It ' s better for us to introduce ourselves to each other . Who would like to begin first ? Any volunteers ?",
          " Yes , please .",
          "What upsets you ?",
          " It is not your mother finding one for you ?",
          " Perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type .",
          " No , there is an updated virgin , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum <MASK> .",
          " I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight .",
          " Don ' t worry . There are many other options using the internet as dating methods . Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher .",
          "Now let's begin the class . Who is on duty today ?",
          " Please come to the front to have <MASK> ' free talk in English . Very well ! Whose turn is it to have a free talk ?",
          " Well . Don't forget to perform your duty next time , ok ? Now , let's start our lesson .",
          "Howdy ! Nice car ! What seems to be the problem ?",
          " Not sure yet.How about you pop the hood and we can take a look . Mmmm , it doesn ' t look good .",
          " Well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .",
          " I ' m afraid a bit more than that . We need to order the spare parts , take apart your electrical system , fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . You are going to have to leave it here for <MASK> .",
          "Are you alright , Ethan ? You don't seem to be as cheerful as you normally are .",
          " What happened ?",
          " What did your boss say ?",
          " That's horrible . Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work ?",
          " Is your boss Chinese ?",
          " What are you going to do ?",
          " That sounds like a sensible plan . Do you want me to help you with your job search ?",
          " Don't mention it . That's what friends are for !",
          "... Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter , Ed ! Give us some good news . How are things looking for us in terms sales this month ?",
          " What ? Ed , don ' t tell me you only have bad news !",
          " For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ?",
          " What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ' s the bad news ?",
          " Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess !",
          " We ' re doomed !",
          " Really ? What !",
          "Miss Fallen , can you tell me why you want to get a visa to the States ?",
          " And do you have the Letter of Acceptance from the University with you ?",
          " Thank you very much . And do you have any proof of the financial support for the three years ?",
          " Could I see that , please ?",
          " Thanks very much . Well , I'll be able to give you a visa for one year , a student visa , that is .",
          " Yes , it is a <MASK> , but you can renew the visa each year in the States . It is our usual procedure .",
          "The sun is up ! Time for all the campers to rise . Time to get paddling .",
          " Do not worry . Today will be easier .",
          " Today is Saturday .",
          " Today is July 4th .",
          " Call her on my cell phone . Wish her \u201c Happy Birthday ! \u201d Tell her you are out exploring the great American wilderness . Tell her I said she is lucky to be born on Independence Day .",
          " It is December 25th .",
          " Yes , I am lucky . I was born on Christ ' s birthday . Maybe that is why I usually go to church on Sundays . When is your birthday ?",
          " That is true ! Here , have some Granola for breakfast .",
          " After eating , we will take down our tent . Then we will pack everything into the canoe , We can shove off by 6",
          " How about going for swim around 10",
          " Happy Independence Day !",
          "Have you been in America long , Hellen ?",

          " For <MASK> .",
          "Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long",
          " Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ' s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ' re out the door . Half an hour , tops .",
          " True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ?",
          "In my country , we go to school from 8 o'clock in the morning until <MASK> .",
          " Actually , five and a half.On Saturday , we have classes only in the morning .",
          " That's too much for us really .",
          " I'm going to try to find out where the school is located .",
          " I'm going to register right now .",
          "So , you ' re applying for a B2 visa , where is your final destination and what ' s the purpose of your trip to the United States ?",
          " And how long do you you plan to remain in the United States ?",
          " And , who is sponsoring your trip ?",
          " Alright , tell me about the ties you have to your home country .",
          " And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ?",
          " I ' m sorry , sir , we cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time , instead , you are granted a resident visa ! Congratulations , you are the millionth person to apply for a visa ! You win ! Congratulations !",
          "I would like to register for a class today .",
          " I would very much enjoy taking a Psychology class.Because I'm crazy .",
          " Which days are these classes on ?",
          " What about the other class ?",
          " Are you sure there are no more open classes ?",
          " Sign me up for Monday and Wednesday .",

          "I see that there are Olympic mascots in your car .",
          " Me , too . I want to be a volunteer for <MASK> Beijing Olympics .",
          " No problem . I'm an ' Olympic expert ' .",
          " The ancient Olympics originated in ancient Greece .",
          " They name it after the place where it was first held .",
          " This question is a piece of cake . A Frenchman named Baron de Coubertin .",
          " Of course he was called ' the father of the Olympics ' .",
          " He once made a speech on the \u2018 Renaissance of the Olympics ' .",
          " I've told you I'm an expert .",
          "It's going to strike 12 o'clock . Let's get the firecrackers ready , Rose .",
          " Well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . It's OK here . It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there .",
          " What other activities will you have tomorrow ?",
          " Do you bring some gifts along ?",

          " Yeah . I remember it very clearly . The pain makes it easy to remember . I know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups .",
          " I know it's painful , but it's only temporary . After the pain goes away , you'll find other girls .",
          " You'll change your mind . Look at everyone in the world . They all break up and move on . The faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover .",
          " I also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . You know she didn't treat you that well . Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?",

          " Really ! Did she tell you why she didn't show up ?",
          " What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ?",
          " I can't believe she would do that to you . It's so dishonest-and rude !",
          " I bet you that she regrets what she's done . You are such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn't she ?",
          " So I don't think you'll have a problem finding another girlfriend . There are plenty of fish in the sea !",
          "Excuse me , Professor , is there a time when I could meet with you ?",

          " Do you know what time it starts ?",
          " Let's meet for lunch at eleven thirty and afterwards , we can head over there .",
          "Would you talk to me about taking one of Dr . Miller's classes ?",
          " I'm thinking about taking his class next semester .",
          " I'm not sure because I really need to learn something , but I also worry about grades .",
          " I really need to learn this stuff .",
          " Yes , that sounds right for me .",
          " Yeah , I already knew that . That could be a good thing .",
          "Hello , Anna speaking !",
          " Jason , where have you been hiding lately ? You know it's been a long time since your last call . Have you been good ?",
          " I am fine . What have you been doing ?",
          " That's great , congratulations !",
          " That's good . So I guess I'll have to make an appointment to see you .",
          " How long have you been working there ?",
          " How do you like your new boss ?",
          " Much better than the last one , huh ?",
          " Forget about him . Come over to my house tonight . Let's get drunk .",
          " 8 it is . See you then .",
          "What can I do for you ?",
          " Let me have them .",
          " These books are <MASK> late .",
          " You ' re going to have to pay late fees .",
          " 25 cents a day .",
          " That means 25 cents for each late book .",
          "Hi Jane , can you let me know the best way to get to your house this evening ?",
          " I need to be in the city centre this afternoon so I will be coming straight from there .",
          " Got that .",
          " Hold on , I am looking at the map now . Ok , I can see Horntown Road . Do I go straight at the intersection ?",
          " Ok , I can see that road .",
          " Good , I can see the library on the map .",
          " That's great , see you at seven .",
          "Do you have girlfriend ?",
          " Well , I came to know a girl <MASK> . We have so much in common .",
          " So I think I may fall in love with her .",
          " Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in real love ?",
          " That's what I do .",
          " Yes .",
          " That's it . She likes dogs so much now , and I begin to love dogs .",
          " Thanks , but I know falling in love is one thing while staying in love is another .",
          " Yeah , falling in love is so good .",
          "The Spring Festival is drawing close . By then we will have five days off . I am expecting it .",
          " Just like you celebrate Christmas , we celebrate our lunar New Year's Day , the Spring Festival . It is a time for the family members and relatives to have a get-together .",
          " Christmas has more religious nature , while our Spring Festival is a more traditional holiday . On the New Year's Eve , we have a big dinner called ' Family Reunion Dinner ' . One of the traditional food to eat at the dinner is dumplings . After that , the adults usually sit chatting , watching TV , or playing cards .",
          " They usually go outside to play firecrackers and fireworks .",
          " Perhaps it is like what people told you . At <MASK> , the time when the New Year really comes , we exchange ' Happy New Year ' to each other , and parents and grandparents will take out small packages wrapped with red paper , in them are some what we call ' Lucky Money .",
          " Of course the children .",
          "May I help you ?",
          " It closes at six .",
          " No , not every day .",
          " Absolutely .",
          " Saturday ' s hours are from <MASK> to six-thirty at night .",
          " What else can I help you with ?",
          "hello , Kate ! How are you doing ?",
          " fine . How are your term papers ?",
          " how could it be ? They are due <MASK> .",
          " Kate , you know , I am thinking of getting a part-time job next year because I really need more money and I don't want to ask my parents for any more . But I'm so busy ! How am I going to work and study",
          " my advisor ?",
          "Look at this , A Brief Introduction of Hollywood .",
          " What ? How much do you know Hollywood ?",
          " You are full of boasts . I can examine you by question and answer . What is Hollywood ? Where is it ? What is the function of it ?",
          " Not bad . What kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930 ' s",
          " Mm . What came after that ?",
          " Pretty good . Please continue .",
          " The western films about America's cowboys , Indians and early settlers .",
          " Since <MASK> ' s , there are horror movies about people who encounter frightening , unnatural situations , and serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened , and science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds . Some people have also enjoyed watching psycho-dramas about the everyday problems that people have .",
          " Of course , no list of film would be complete without animated movies . These are especially popular among children .",
          "I have a problem .",
          " My mattress was supposed to be delivered today .",
          " The delivery people showed up <MASK> late .",
          " I was late for work because of them .",
          " I want my money back for the delivery .",
          " It shouldn't be a problem .",
          "Which team do you think will emerge with the last laugh in this World Cup ?",
          " No , they aren't . They had a hard time in the group stage and only sealed a sit in the eighth-finals with Wallack ' s header in <MASK> . Just think , group A consists of Austria , China , and Saudi Arabia , all of which are minnows .",
          " Well , at least the Germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield . They recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against Austria . And they to be endowed with perfect positional sense . I think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later .",
          " That's why I still have very high hopes for the team . Now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock-out stage , the Germans will probably make it through to the finals .",
          "Adam . I ' m sorry .",
          " Yes , But I couldn ' t help it . I was late getting off work for a start and then I miss the bus . The bus I did catch that stuck in the traffic jam . It was one thing after another .",
          " Yes . But those are the rush in that moment . And my boss ask me to do some urgent letters .",
          " Well , no . I thought I \u2018 Ve finish in <MASK> . and I didn ' t want to be difficult about just few minutes , if I hadn ' t been missing the bus and in the traffic I wouldn ' t have been so late . I ' m sorry .",
          "Eric , how long will you be in China ?",
          " Well , have you ever thought about learning some Chinese ?",
          " Don't worry . All things are difficult before they are easy .",

          "Get up as early as <MASK> only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . What a life ! I've had enough of it .",
          " What should I do then ?",
          " I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ?",
          "Hi , Lander . What's wrong ?",
          " Same here . I have't brought any new clothes for <MASK> .",
          " True . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .",

          " Have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ?",
          " That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it .",
          " How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?",
          " Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse .",
          " Good idea . That will help us to warm up .",
          " Alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .",
          "Can you be serious for a moment , we've been dating for 6 months now , I really like you . I'd like to take a relationship to the next level .",
          " It feels like you are not dedicate to our relationship . It seems like you treat it as a just casual dating .",
          " I don't want to be like this . I think we should get step further .",
          " Like what ?",
          " It was only the cheek .",
          " Oh , that is ridiculous .",
          " Definitely not .",
          "Will you be joining Billy and I at the Bar ?",

          " I want to stop off at my apartment to get changed so I should be there by 9 pm .",
          " Certainly . But if there are going to be four of us , I had better make reservations .",
          " Then I'II make reservations for <MASK> for a party of four .",
          " Not that I know of . Why do you ask ?",
          " I hear the drinks and food there are moderately priced.You should be fine .",
          " No , its very casual there . Leave your jacket and tie at home .",
          " I'll see you there at 9pm .",
          "Hey , there's Leo . I wonder why he's walking arm in arm with that young woman .",
          " You're pulling my leg ! She must be thirty years younger than Leo . Talk about robbing the cradle !",
          " It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn't have a girlfriend last week .",
          "Ben , what are you doing ?",
          " Why ?",
          " Have you thought about graduate school ?",
          " Would you mind telling me then \u2014 what were those <MASK> of college for ? What was the point of all that hard work ?",
          " Now listen , Ben . Look , I think it ' s a very good thing that a young man \u2014 after he ' s done some very good work \u2014 should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself , and lie around , and drink beer and so on . But after a few weeks I believe that person should want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass .",
          "What did you say ?",
          " Well , I feel a little tired .",
          " Then can you wait a few minutes ? I want to finish writing this letter .",
          " I won't be long . <MASK> . Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park ?",
          "What day is it ?",
          " I'm leaving on November 10th .",

          " Right .",
          "Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ?",
          " Well , I ' Ve always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ?",
          " Don ' t you think you would miss having other people around ?",
          " If China didn ' t have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ?",
          " Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?",
          "Excuse me . Do you have the time ?",
          " Is it ? Oh , no . The concert will begin in <MASK> . Are we too late to get there ?",
          "How is everything going with your girlfriend ?",
          " Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did ' t know that you had split up . What happened ?",
          " Really ! Did she tell you why she didn ' t show up ?",
          " What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ?",
          " I can ' t believe she would do that to you . It ' s so dishonest---and rude !",
          " I bet you she regrets what she ' s done . You were such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn ' t she ?",
          " I know . It ' s always nice to have some closure , but I don ' t think you ' ll have a problem finding another girlfriend .",
          "Dad , what's the date ?",
          " In <MASK> it will be Christmas Day .",
          " So , can I buy some new shoes as a Christmas present ?",
          "Do you have spare time tonight ?",
          " There will be a live show of football tonight .",
          " AC Milan versus Real Madrid .",
          " Absolutely .",
          " Great idea ! Here we go !",
          "I don ' t know what I ' m going to do ! It ' s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job !",
          " It was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , one small mistake can cost the company millions .",
          " That ' s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ' s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ' m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ' s nothing I can do about that . My boss won ' t believe me if I tell him the truth .",
          " I have enough to live off of for <MASK> . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ' d rather invest my money somehow .",
          " Next month . So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year .",
          " That ' s very generous of you . I guess that would work .",
          " I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing !",
          "Hey ! Fred , you are <MASK> than me today . Usually , you don't .",
          " What's your meaning ?",
          " You are a thief ?",
          " You mean it is a still virtual game . Your friends steal your vegetables time and time again , and you take theirs as well , right ?",
          " Don't be addicted to the game . It's not good for your job .",
          "Hey Lucas , how was your trip to Paris ?",
          " Did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower .",
          " What else did you see ?",
          " You must have had a great time .",
          " Yes . you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad.sometimes new food might disagree with you .",
          " That is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful .",
          "Hi , Larry , how was your weekend ?",
          " Great . I hung out with Jo all day shopping , and the went out for dinner together .",
          " Yeah , I never thought we could be good friends either . We have our differences . She's more outgoing and active while I am more quiet and reversed , but we still get along extremely well . We can talk for hours about anything .",
          " When Jo and I are together , we argue a lot , but that's also part of the fun . Besides , I know she will always be there for me when I need her , and she knows I'll be there for her .",
          " Exactly . Having Jo as my friend is one of the best things that's ever happened to me .",
          " Thanks , I think so too .",
          "Do you surf online regularly , Joe ?",
          " Are you crazy ? What are you doing <MASK> online ?",
          " Online chat ? Aren't you afraid of meeting bad people who pretend to be what they are not ?",
          " It sounds interesting .",
          "Hi , I'm Lucas , I just moved in next door .",
          " Nice to meet you too .",
          " Thanks . Some tea would be nice . Chinese tea is great . I really like your tea set . Where did you get it ?",
          " Oh yeah , I saw the tea house the other day . I think I might go and have a look sometime . It's a nice neighborhood here .",
          " There's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight .",
          " That would be wonderful . Thanks !",
          "Hello , Catherine . Would you like to go out tomorrow ?",
          " Yeah , I was thinking we could get a bite to eat and catch a movie .",
          " Yes . We can do something else if you like .",
          " Well . What time would you like me to pick you up ?",
          " Good . I will see you then .",
          " Bye .",
          "What happened to that girl you were seeing ?",
          " That was a short relationship . You only started dating 2 months ago .",
          " What do you mean ?",
          " She sounds very emotional .",
          " Were you suppose to be there ?",
          " Ok . You're right . She's a psycho .",
          "I'm too tired now . I've already worked for <MASK> overtime !",
          " Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day .",
          " I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project .",
          " I will , thanks for your concern .",
          "Hi , Natasha , how's life ?",
          " Oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ?",
          " I have a small family . They are my parents , my younger brother and me .",
          " Yes , it did . But my parents are ethnic minority people . It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children .",
          " The child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one day .",
          " Yes , we are very close . He is <MASK> now and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot .",
          " Thank you .",
          "Let's go see pandas ! The news said that two pandas arrived at the zoo last week .",
          " How can we get there ?",
          " OK ! Let's go .",
          " Yes , you can find hundreds of various animals here . It is the biggest zoo in Taiwan .",
          " Where can find the pandas ? I think we are here to see the pandas .",
          " It should take <MASK> to get there . Are there any shuttle buses running place to place around the whole zoo ?",
          "Hi , how are you doing ?",
          " Same here.Have you seen any new films recently ?",
          " Oh . really ? I saw it <MASK> . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking .",
          " It reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world .",
          " Well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend to end quickly too .",
          " Oh , that's too short-lived .",
          " II can't agree more . The only-child-generation in China tends to know little about marriage .",
          " In their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone .",
          "I'm really curious . What is it like doing housework all day for a living ?",
          " I still think that it is a bitstrange that you like to do that kind of thing . Most women would rather hire a maid .",
          " How Ay clients do you have already ?",
          " Wow . Too bad I don't have a clue about housework .",
          "So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ?",
          " That's cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ?",
          " I couldn't even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then I'd have to find my own place .",
          " Not really , they just don't want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for <MASK> . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out .",
          " My parents just didn't handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it's important that I should learn how to live on my own .",
          "When do you celebrate Thanksgiving ?",
          " What do you eat on that day ?",
          " Anything else ?",
          " I'm almost hungry .",
          "So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ?",
          " Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ?",
          " Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right .",
          " Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy .",
          " And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common .",
          " Well , at least going to college won't be too bad . Since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college .",
          "Hi , Anna . I haven ' t seen you for ages . Where have you been ?",
          " No wonder I haven ' t seen you recently . Where did you spend your holidays ?",
          " You must have a wonderful time .",
          " No , my wife doesn ' t like traveling . We haven ' t been traveling for more than ten years . The first time we traveled together was in <MASK> when we just got married . We spent our honeymoon in the Alps .",
          "Hello , is this People's Theater ?",
          " Yes , are advance tickets for ' Nut croakers ' still available ?",
          " October 16th .",
          " 7:30 p . m . performance , please .",
          " I'd like to reserve two seats at 100 yuan , please .",
          " Du Kun .",
          " Tomorrow .",
          " How do we cancel , just in case ?",
          " All right , thank you very much . Good bye .",
          "Hey Mark . What are you doing ?",
          " Anything interesting on ?",
          " So I take it you're pretty bored too .",
          " It's Saturday and we are sitting at home doing nothing . What's wrong with us ?",
          " I already tried to call up some of the guys , but they are all busy .",
          " She's out shopping with her friends .",
          " Aright . Do you have any cigarettes ?",
          " Ok . See you there in <MASK> .",
          "Hey Claire , you've been really quiet these last few days . Is something wrong ?",
          " Well , stress is a real thing . It's not an imaginary condition .",
          " You're not weak ... you're stressed out ! Stress has been a part of the human condition for <MASK> . Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators ... and as you might imagine , that was pretty stressful .",
          " But you're actually having the same reaction as our tree-dwelling ancestors ! It's called the flight or fight response . Each time you feel like something's threatening you , your body decides whether to run away or fight ... it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body .",
          " It could . Modern humans actually have more flight or fight responses than our ancestors did . They just had a couple of close calls every day , but today , we have dozens or even hundreds !",
          "Jenny , I was wondering if you , um ... are you busy this Friday ?",
          " Oh . What about Saturday ? Are you free then ?",
          " What about tonight ? Do you have plans tonight ?",
          " Yes ! Yes ! I want to take you to dinner .",
          "Hello Gina ! We've spoken so many times on the phone but's it's so good to finally meet you in person !",
          " Oh , please don't call me sir . Just call me Jason .",
          " Pretty good . There was a bit of turbulence while we were over the Pacific Ocean but it wasn't too bad . The worst thing was the guy behind me . He snored all through the night !",
          " The stewardess said it's not company policy to wake people up for any reason .",
          " Not much ... but that's ok ... I'm a night owl anyway .",
          " I'd love to squeeze in a trip to the Great Wall .",
          "Good morning , Jason . How did you sleep ?",
          " Great ! So , are you ready for a full day of shopping ?",
          " I know a place that should be perfect . It's called the China Friendship Shopping Center and it's pretty much like an American mall - except with more variety . You can even buy a live chicken there if you want .",
          " Well . I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person . You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that . But ... if you're smart , you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price .",
          " For starters , you want to do a lot of scouting first . You've got to know what things cost .",
          " That could be helpful . But when you go into a shopping center ... prices become very flexible . You have to be able to read the market .",
          "Li Lei , can you tell me what the origin of Easter is ?",
          " Oh , then when do you celebrate Easter ?",
          " How do you celebrate it ?",
          " That sounds interesting .",
          "Hey Bobby . What's going on ?",
          " I forgot my cigarette today . Do you have another one ?",
          " Thanks .",
          " Really ? I've been smoking for over a year now .",
          " You ever tried to quit ?",
          " Yeah . I tried to quit last month , and I thought it was going to be easy , but it turns out that I'm still smoking .",
          " I think you're right . Aright . Gotta go to class . Thanks for the cigarette . I'll talk to you later .",
          "Hey , Daniel , how's it going ?",
          " Wow , it's so strange for you to say things like that . What had happened ?",
          " Did your teacher tell you the route he took ?",
          " Great , do you still remember when he started his voyage ?",
          " Good , by the way , do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you ?",
          " You should speed up , because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today .",
          " That's my boy ! Wait , Daniel , when is Pirates of the Caribbean on ?",
          " Exactly , now , tell me the time .",
          "You are married to a foreigner , aren't you ? So what's it like ?",
          " Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures .",
          " Oh , so he's half Chinese and half American . That's unusual . What languages does he speak , then ?",
          " What does he look like ? Can people tell ?",
          "Hello , let me introduce myself . I'm your neighbor . My name is Shirley .",
          " Nice to meet you , too .",
          " Here is a little gift for your family . It's a calendar with all the community events on it . I hope it can be helpful .",
          " Since we are neighbors , if you need any help or anything , please come to me .",
          " Oh , don't worry about that here . There are security guards on duty <MASK> a day and they patrol all over the neighborhood . You know , they are all very strong .",
          " Of course . There is a Carrefour near the neighborhood . I'll show you there if you want to .",
          " By the way , a party will be held for new neighbors the day after tomorrow . I hope I can see you there .",
          "Good morning , you look very tired .",
          " Did you hold a party or something else yesterday ?",
          " I don't like this program , because there are too many constant arguments between the judges .",
          " Do you have much time watching TV ?",
          " I don't like ads , either . But ads could bring big profits to the TV station .",
          "Thanks for offering to give me a lift . I'm looking forward to this party , but I didn't want to go alone .",
          " No , this is my first . Last week I went to a cookout 5 for new professors at Dean Barksdale's home . I took a taxi because I didn't want to be late . But I was the first one there .",
          " You're right . The invitation said two to seven . I was there at two o'clock , but most people didn't arrive until three or four . They didn't start cooking until five o ' clock .",
          " Thanks for telling me this .",
          " Why are you in such a hurry ? They said , Dinner at eight , and it's only seven-fifteen . I don't want to be the first one there again .",
          "Hello . Nice to see you again . I heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . I hope everything ' s OK .",
          " I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital .",
          " It must have really hurt afterwards .",
          " I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital .",
          " Is there any pain now ?",
          " Did they take good care of you in the hospital ?",
          "How often do you use the internet ?",
          " Yes . I use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . It can be frustrating when the connection is poor .",
          " Yes , I like the job though . Sometimes , I help other people in the office if they ' re having trouble online .",
          " I think it ' s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . First , a lot of the information you find online is false . Second , when you buy something online , you don ' t see it until you actually get it .",
          " What I do is find the website of shops . Then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they ' re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .",
          "Are you an art aficionado ?",
          " I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art .",
          " Art isn ' t for everyone . I ' m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ' s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture .",
          " I thought I ' d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there .",
          " Let ' s meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or <MASK> to see all of the exhibits .",
          "The weather is really miserable . It has been raining hard all day long .",
          " Do you think the rain is going to let up soon ?",
          " How long does the rainy season last ?",
          " I can hardly stand these wet and cold days . It seems that it doesn't bother you very much .",
          " But I prefer warm weather .",
          " I hope so .",
          "What day is today ?",
          " What's the date today ?",
          " Oh , today's International Labour Day . Is it our working day ?",
          "London is such a historical city ! There ' s history everywhere you look . There ' s nelson ' s column , built as a monument to one of the Britain ' s great admirals and his important victory . He won the battle of Trafalgar in 1805 .",
          " Nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ' s the statue of Boadicea . She fought the Romans when they invaded Britain .",
          " She was a very controversial leader . Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later ?",
          " I ' m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . I really want to see the crown jewels too .",
          " Where ' s that ? Oh , I know ! Madame Tussaud ' s the waxworks museum .",
          " Sometimes , it ' s hard to know who belongs in each section of the museum !",
          "What ' s the life expectancy in your country ?",
          " About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ' s a problem that will soon affect most of the world .",
          " Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .",
          " How ' s your son these days ?",
          " He ' ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you mine it is a good age to have a child ?",
          " Yes , I think you ' re right . I ' m thinking about having a child , but not just yet .",
          " Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ' t often succeed .",
          " It ' s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild .",
          "Hi , Tina , I've got good news . I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company . They informed me to go to the final round next Monday . It looks very promising .",
          " Thanks . Let's go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ?",
          " No problem . See you !",
          "So , you friend ' s getting married on Saturday . What have you bought her as a wedding gift . I find is so hard to choose the right gift .",
          " That ' s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ' s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ?",
          " So , what did you get them ?",
          " What ' s wrong with it ?",
          " Household appliance don ' t seem to last for a long time nowadays .",
          "Yeah , I ' Ve just moved here , and I ' d like to activate my cell phone , and I ' m not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan , or a monthly rate plan .",
          " What ? Really ? I don ' t really want to have to buy a new phone .",
          " Really ? What ' s the catch ?",
          " So what does this plan include ?",
          " Wow , all this for forty dollars per month ?",
          "You are quite busy every day .",
          " So you have to work all day .",
          " I see you sometimes work on weekends , too .",
          "Steven , I need badly your help .",
          " My wife has found that I have an affair with my secretary , and now she is going to divorce me .",
          " Yes , I know I'm wrong . But I swear that the affair lasts only for <MASK> . And I still love my wife . I couldn't live without her .",
          " Yes , I swear .",
          "Trina , will you marry me ?",
          " Oh , Babe , I can ' t wait to spend the rest of my life with you ! I can ' t wait for all the adventures we ' re going to have , for all the fights and the laughter . I can ' t wait to grow old and wrinkly with you .",
          " She what ?",
          " Four hundred ?",
          " Ah ...",
          " Wow .",
          " If I survive <MASK> .",
          "Jim , I heard you took a trip to San Diego . Is that right ?",
          " That sounds really nice . What did you do there ?",
          " Did you take any pictures ?",
          " Sure , I love looking at photos .",
          " Your daughter looks like her mother .",
          " Where was this picture taken ?",
          " Did you have time to go to the zoo ?",
          " It looks like you all had a nice time .",
          "What are your weekend arrangements ?",
          " What sort of things are you interested in ?",
          " I love swimming and cycling . On Sunday morning I have swimming practice for an hour . In the afternoon , I just ride my bike around the city or along the country roads for almost <MASK> .",
          " Mostly in the city's swimming pool . But on occasion , I go to the beach with friends . Well , what do you do at leisure ?",
          " Good.You really know how to enjoy yourself .",
          "Let's meet tonight at the Thai restaurant at about 5 .",
          " Why don't you walk ? It's only <MASK> walking and it's a nice evening .",
          " Ha-ha , see you then .",
          "Oh man ! I ' Ve been starving myself for days now and I haven ' t lost an ounce !",
          " Yeah , my friend is getting married next month and I ' m supposed to be a bridesmaid . I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding , but I haven ' t lost any weight ! Look at these love handles .",
          " Why ? If I eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ?",
          " So you are saying that I should eat , but I should just watch what I eat ?",
          " If I do all this do you think I can lose twenty pounds in <MASK> ?",
          "Adam , I'm sorry !",
          " Yes , but I couldn't help it . I was late getting off work for a start , and then I missed the bus . The bus I did catch got caught in a traffic jam . It was one thing after another .",
          " Yes , but there's a rush on at the moment , and my boss asked me to do some urgent letters .",
          " Well , no . I thought I'd finish in <MASK> , and I didn't want to be difficult about just a few minutes . If it hadn't been for missing the bus and the traffic , I wouldn't have been so late . I'm sorry .",
          "Alright everyone settle down . Let ' s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ?",
          " No , that ' s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ' Day .",
          " No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .",
          " In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ' s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .",
          " Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .",
          " Well , as we say , the rest is history ...",
          "What time is it , Tom ?",
          " Is it ? I had no idea it was so late . I must be off now .",
          " I must catch the nine-thirty train .",
          "What ' s \u201c pi \u201d ?",
          " I see . What is that ratio exactly ?",
          " It ' s 10 centimeters , so the circumference should be 31.4 centimeters .",
          " According to the newspaper , the exchange rate is 1.85 dollars to the pound .",
          " What ' s the next question .",
          " I can help you there . Those are numbers that cannot be created by multiplying two whole numbers , apart from the number itself and 1 , together .",
          " Exactly . Anything else ?",
          " You ' ll be a mathematician <MASK> .",
          "Did you watch TV last night , Rose ?",
          " What was it about ?",
          " If so , we may live there someday .",
          " Sure . I heard about this on the TV . On January 3rd , 2004 , Explorer Spirit landed near the so-called Guser Crater . And <MASK> , Spirit's twin explorer , Opportunity , landed on Meridian Planum named by scientists .",
          "What are the seasons like in your city ?",
          " Does it ever rain in summer ?",
          " What are spring and autumn like ?",
          " Well , I live in the southern hemisphere , so our summertime is your wintertime , and vice versa . We get some rain in every season , but most is in winter . In winter , it sometimes gets cold , but our winters are usually quite mild . Summers are warm , but not hot . Spring and autumn are both very short-sometimes just a few weeks each . The weather is very changeable then-just like spring in your city .",
          " No , I don ' t . I go on a winter holiday instead . I go somewhere warm .",
          "Hello , could you arrange a dinner for us ?",
          " Eight o'clock tomorrow evening .",
          " Ten .",
          " Chinese food .",
          " No , not too lavish .",
          " What is the usual thing here ?",
          " Let's say sixty Yuan then .",
          " We'd like to have typical Chinese food .",
          " No snakes , please .",
          " Mao Tai and Qingdao Beer .",
          " Right , thanks .",
          " See you then .",
          "How do you usually spend your time , now that you ' Ve retired ?",
          " What do you have for breakfast ?",
          " that sounds nice . How do you spend your mornings ?",
          " How do you spend your afternoons ?",
          "Good morning . Sanyu Restaurant . May I help you ?",
          " We open at 6:30 , sir .",
          " Yes , sir . What time would you like your table , sir ?",
          " Fine ! I'll reserve a table for two at <MASK> , sir . May I have your name , please ?",
          " Thank you , Mr . Davis .",

          " We'll try our best .",
          "These days my son has turned his computer into an electronic playground . He plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other things on the computer . The funny thing about it is that , no matter what he plays , he always wins first place . I wonder if he'll be able to cope with a defeat in real life .",
          " That's exactly like my wife . She spends <MASK> a day on the computers discussing things ranging from stock prices to soft-ware standards .",
          "Let's have seafood tonight and then go see the new movie at Mall Cinema.Betsy told me it's a beautiful love story and I shouldn't miss it .",
          " No , we didn't . Last week we went to see that movie about a man's struggle against mental illness .",
          " Oh , yeah , and I did promise to see it with you if we went to that movie last week.But you liked that movie , didn't you ?",
          " It wasn't that bad , and you're the one that insisted on skipping dinner.We went to an excellent restaurant .",
          " And I don't like meat that much.The only meat I eat is chicken .",
          " Well , I suppose that , to be fair , you should get to pick the movie and we can go to a restaurant that serves meat .",
          "Where's Bill ? The ambassador is already here . The meeting is set to start at 9 am .",
          " Even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there , I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late . He takes the train , remember ?",
          " Well , to be fare , since he's coming all the way from Lancaster , he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us . He must get start on his commute about six thirty , no telling what time he actually gets up .",
          " Why doesn't he just drive to work ?",
          "Hi , Steven ! What do you like to do during the weekend ?",
          " That ' s great ! I think they do you a lot of good .",
          " But why do you choose cycling at first ?",
          " You are really a good citizen .",
          "So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ?",
          " Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ?",
          " Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right .",
          " Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy .",
          " And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common .",
          "What's the matter , Lisa ? You don't look too good .",
          " You mean Mark ? He seems like such an honest guy .",
          " Two months ? How did you find out ?",
          " So you asked him about the girl who called ?",
          " What'd he do ?",
          " Indiscretion ? How can an indiscretion last two months ? I mean , you two have been married for <MASK> ! How can he do that to you ?",
          " Good . I totally agree with what you did .",
          "So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ?",
          " That ' s cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ?",
          " I couldn ' t even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then ' d have to find my own place .",
          " Not really , they just don ' t want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for <MASK> . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out .",
          " My parents just didn ' t handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it ' s important that I should learn how to live on my own .",
          "Tom , you look thoughtful and unhappy recently . What's wrong with you ?",
          " Why ? I mean , why did she part company with you after <MASK> together ?",
          " Do you believe her excuse ?",
          " Come on , buddy , cheer up . Why not do some sports with me ? Violent exercise might help to shake you out of your disappointment in love .",
          "Hey , Sandy , what's new ? Interested in a movie tonight ?",
          " Soup kitchen ? Is that a new restaurant or something ?",
          " How did you get involved in something like that ?",
          " So what do you do there ?",
          " Yeah , it sounds easy . How long does it take ?",
          " I don't know . I mean , I like helping the community and all that , but I don't know if I have the time ...",
          "Mary , would you like to get something to eat with me ?",
          " At 10 o'clock .",
          " No , at night .",
          " OK , how about 1:30 PM ?",
          " How about 5:00 PM ?",
          " OK , see you then .",
          "Hi , Kate .",
          " Yeah , I saw someone walking like you , but I wasn ' t sure . We haven ' t seen each other for how long ? Almost three months ? But you look quite different now .",

          "have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ?",

          " I think you're being a little critical . The actor in the lead role is fantastic . I suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though .",
          " actually , the woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine .",

          " Yes , I think you're right . I'm thinking about having a child , but not just yet .",
          " Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life.Parents usually try to discour",

          " Are they going to frisk all the passengers ?",
          "Hi , Mary , can I have a minute ?",
          " Well , actually I want to tell you that I've put in notice .",
          " Many reasons . I've been here for too long . Next year will be my five-year anniversary . I want a change of setting . Besides , our company is downsizing . I don't want to stay on just to be let go .",
          " Maybe . But that's not kept the new boss from breathing down my neck . To be honest , I've got a better offer from another company .",

          " But that ' s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ' t have the best work ethic , I ' m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients .",

          " Well sir , as you know , I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years .",
          " I won ' t beat around the bush . Sir , I would like a raise . I currently have three companies after me and so I decided to talk to you first .",

          " I think you are looking at the wrong line . The rapid drop in sales wasn't our hair products . You are correct , the hair product sales decreased slightly , but not dramatically . The one that didn't do so hot this month was the cleaning products . I think there was a problem in the marketing plan .

          " Are you serious ? Fighting ? But I didn't hear anything on the news .",
          " Oh , this is terrible , Yuri . Terrible ! So we can't even assess the damages . How can we do business in this country ? Either we're buried under mud , or we're in danger of getting kidnapped.No , I can't believe this mess !",
          " You don't have to keep saying that , Yuri . It's not your fault.But me--I'm the one who should be sorry.It was me who suggested operations here in the first place ! Oh , what can we do ?",

          " to be honest , he has no authority . He's a hard-worker , but no one listens to him .",

          "I ' Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles .",
          " Why , your price has soared . It ' s almost 25 % higher than last year ' s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price .",
          " I ' m afraid I can ' t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ' Ve received from other sources .",
          " I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ' s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ' t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ' t changed much over the years .",
          " Well , we ' ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ' ll have to try , I suppose .",
          "I'm pleased to meet you again , Mrs . King .",
          " You've had a good trip , I hope .",
          " It's been a full two years since we last saw each other .",
          " We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement .",
          " Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line .",
          " But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end .",
          " 500 pieces .",
          " All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission .",
          " We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own .",
          " Another thing is that <MASK> we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products .",
          " Good , that's all then .",
          "First of all , I would like to thank you for your kind invitation to visit your beautiful country . I hope my visit will help to promote a friendly relationship between us .",
          " I would like to tell you that my clients are very satisfied with the last delivery of your slippers . The styles and colors are very much to the taste of our market .",
          " I understand you are selling the same products to some other Australian importers . This tends to complicate my business . As you know , I am experienced in the business of slippers and enjoy a good business relationship with all the leading whole - sabers and retailers in that line . I have a mind to expand this business in the years to come . One of the reasons of my visit here is to sign a sole agency agreement with you on these items for a period of 3 years . As it is to our mutual interests and profit , I am sure you'll have no objection to it .",
          " I'll come to that . My proposal is",
          " Well , I admit I always do business on the safe side . Could you let me have your proposal then ?",
          " You certainly drive a hard bargain , Mrs . Brown .",
          " Well , if you put it this way , I'll have to comply . When shall we sign the contract , Mrs . Brown ?",
          " Tomorrow afternoon will be fine .",
          "To get around your difficulty , Mr . Brown , I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an Addi trional order later .",
          " A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered .",
          " Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space - - all this takes time , you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month .",
          " When will that be ?",
          " You can rest assured of that . We'll book you order and inquire for the shipping space now , so that shipment can be effected within two or three weeks of receipt of your L / C .",
          " Very good . Well , thanks to your cooperation , our discussion has been very pleasant and fruitful . I sincerely hope that the volume of trade between us will be even greater in the future .",
          " Well , this is something new . A few of our friends from Europe have also suggested that we participate in joint enterprise with them dealing in some of our goods . We think there are a lot of details to go into .",
          " Naturally , I appreciate your efforts in pushing the sale of Japanese arts and crafts . But I'm not in a position to discuss your proposal today . I must first talk to our director , and discuss it with you some other time .",
          " We'll talk about it next time . Now that everything is settled , let's have a cup of tea , and take our minds off business for a change .",
          "Onxiu Travel Agency , may I help you ?",
          " Your name , please ?",
          " Let me see what's available . Yes , Air China has a flight on May 5th at nine fifteen in the morning .",
          " Single ticket or return ticket ?",
          " Economy fare for single ticket from Beijing to Shanghai is 500 yuan .",
          " Yes , your seat is confirmed on that flight . Pls arrive at the airport <MASK> before departure .",
          "Now we have settled the terms of payment . Is it possible to effect shipment during September ?",
          " Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment ?",
          " That's too late . You see , November is the season for this commodity in our market , and our Customs formalities are rather complicated .",
          " Besides , the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . Thus , after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers . The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season .",
          " Mr . Brown , you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us . If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices , we shall lose out .",
          " That's too bad , but I sincerely hope you will give our request your special consideration .",
          " But can't you find some way to get round your producers for an earlier delivery ? Make a special effort , please . A timely delivery means a lot to us .",
          "Hi , Doris . I hear you are going to the United States next week .",
          " When did you get your passport ?",
          " How long is it valid ?",

          " You've had a good trip , I hope .",
          " It's been a full two years since we last saw each other .",
          " We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement .",
          " Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line .",
          " But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end .",
          " 500 pieces .",
          " All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission .",
          " We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own .",
          " Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products .",
          " Good , that's all then .",
          "We agree to give you a break on the price , all together a discount of 6 % . Good news is , I talked to my boss , he confirmed that if you take care of the shipping costs , we'll throw in insurance .",
          " Now , all this is available to you , as far as you make payment within a <MASK> grace period . That shouldn't be a problem , right ?",
          " So , if all this is agreeable to you , I'll put it all down on paper and fax a contract to you this afternoon . If you can get a signed version of the contract we've agreed upon back to me by tomorrow morning , we can go ahead and make arrangements to ship the product on Tuesday .",
          "I really hope to reach an agreement with you today that is suitable and beneficial for us both . I've thought through a lot of these details , and I hope we can have a chance to discuss them and resolve any differences this afternoon .",
          " Firstly , we'd like to discuss a discounted price . If you can give us a discount of 7 % on the high volumes orders , we can pay in 60 days .",
          " Well , that might be acceptable , if you handle the insurance fees .",
          " We cover the insurance and half the transport fee , and only have a discount of 4 % .",
          " Done ...",
          "I really hope to reach an agreement with you today that is suitable and beneficial for us both . I've thought through a lot of these details , and I hope we can have a chance to discuss them and resolve any differences this afternoon .",
          " Firstly , we'd like to discuss a discounted price . If you can give us a discount of 7 % on the high volumes orders , we can pay in <MASK> .",

          " We cover the insurance and half the transport fee , and only have a discount of 4 % .",
          " Done ...",
          "To get around your difficulty , Mr . Brown , I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an Addi trional order later .",
          " A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered .",
          " Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space - - all this takes time , you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month .",
          " When will that be ?",
          " You can rest assured of that . We'll book you order and inquire for the shipping space now , so that shipment can be effected within two or <MASK> of receipt of your L / C .",
          " Very good . Well , thanks to your cooperation , our discussion has been very pleasant and fruitful . I sincerely hope that the volume of trade between us will be even greater in the future .",
          " Well , this is something new . A few of our friends from Europe have also suggested that we participate in joint enterprise with them dealing in some of our goods . We think there are a lot of details to go into .",
          " Naturally , I appreciate your efforts in pushing the sale of Japanese arts and crafts . But I'm not in a position to discuss your proposal today . I must first talk to our director , and discuss it with you some other time .",
          " We'll talk about it next time . Now that everything is settled , let's have a cup of tea , and take our minds off business for a change .",
          "Now we have settled the terms of payment . Is it possible to effect shipment during September ?",
          " Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment ?",
          " That's too late . You see , November is the season for this commodity in our market , and our Customs formalities are rather complicated .",
          " Besides , the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . Thus , after shipment it will be <MASK> altogether before the goods can reach our retailers . The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season .",
          " Mr . Brown , you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us . If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices , we shall lose out .",
          " That's too bad , but I sincerely hope you will give our request your special consideration .",
          " But can't you find some way to get round your producers for an earlier delivery ? Make a special effort , please . A timely delivery means a lot to us .",
          "Excuse me , is this the Auto Consumer Loan Center ?",
          " Could you tell me something about the terms and interest rates for personal automobile consumer loan ?",
          " I plan to take the loan for <MASK> .",
          " What about the loan repayment ?",
          " Does that mean I should deposit sufficient money to my account prior to the monthly payment date so that you can directly deduct the repayment of the principal and interest ?",
          " That's very thoughtful of you . Thank you so much .",
          "Excuse me , is this the Auto Consumer Loan Center ?",
          " Could you tell me something about the terms and interest rates for personal automobile consumer loan ?",
          " I plan to take the loan for 3 years .",
          " What about the loan repayment ?",
          " Does that mean I should deposit sufficient money to my account prior to the monthly payment date so that you can directly deduct the repayment of the principal and interest ?",
          " That's very thoughtful of you . Thank you so much .",
          "I understand we will need seven air conditioning units on the two floors.That ' s what you think , yes ?",
          " And if we take the Decker units you suggested , what would the price be ?",
          " Isn't there any way we can get central air conditioning in this building ?",
          " That's too much . We need to use the separate units , I guess .",
          " So you say we can do it for 6000 dollars .",
          " You mean installation isn't included ? I'm very surprised .",
          " In Taipei , you know , the company usually installs the things they sell.They don't charge extra .",
          " Yes , I suppose I should get used to it.But I'm not really willing to spend more than 6000 dollars for this.We haven't even opened yet .",
          " And the other company that gave me a quote on this said they could do it for 4000 dollars .",
          " I will tell you what I can agree to.If you can quote me a price of 6000 dollars , installation included , I can accept .",
          " You do seem like a better company than the other one.So I am willing to pay more than 4000 for you . But I won't pay more than 6000 .",
          " Good . I hope we can arrange the contract as soon as possible .",
          "You won't believe what just happened .",
          " I went down to change some money , right ?",
          " I wanted to change around 5000 dollars . And you know the exchange rate .",
          " Not today .",
          " I went into the bank with my money , and I looked at the exchange board.At first I couldn't believe it . I thought I was reading the board wrong or something .",
          " Because the board said 60 pesos for every Taiwan dollar .",
          " I thought it was wrong too . It didn't make sense .",
          " So , I went up to the teller and started to exchange the money . And it's true.They really gave me sixty pesos for the dollar .",

          " Yeah . The test was fairly easy and almost every test-taker could pass that exam . Adult College Entrance Exam is much easier than college entrance exam . And there are fewer subjects .",
          " Do you mean the contract for equipment rental or the one for training ?",

          " Well , standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . Priority is a bit faster and will arrive in <MASK> working days . Express is the fastest , but it ' s also the most expensive . It only takes three days and you can track your package online .",
          " Does your boss pay you for the over-time work ?",
          " He should know that this is against the Labor Law in our country . Legally , employees should get double pay if asked to do extra work during the weekend or on holidays .",
          " I suggest that you go to the lawyers ' office to get some help .",
          " Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate .",
          " He asked me how long it took me to learn English .",
          " Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes .",
          " You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice .",
          " I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm <MASK> old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it .",
          " Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English .",
          " He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good .",
          " This is Mr Brown speaking . I'd like to speak to Mr . Thomas , please .",
          " That's bad ! I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy . Will he be back soon ?",
          " Is there anywhere I can reach him ?",
          " I have a business appointment with him for <MASK> , but I'm afraid I can't make it .",
          " Unfortunately , I'm leaving town rather unexpectedly , and I may be gone for several days .",
          " Thank you .",
          " Thank you .",
          " Only as a clerk in a store .",

          " To encourage the staff increases .",
          " What about the afternoon ?",
          " I'm Mr.Stephen ' s secretary . He has an appointment with Mr.Green today .",
          " I'm afraid we have to reschedule it .",
          " I'm very sorry . But Mr.stephen must leave for Hong Kong right away .",

          " Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage .",
          " It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of comfortable !",

          " No , not exactly , I'm working for minimum wage.And they don't give extra pay for overtime . Overtime is our own time .",
          " They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it's not much of an incentive . They give us a bonus of ten dollars .",
          " I would , but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for .",
          " Good morning , Jamie . What time is it now ?",
          " I see . What is today's schedule ?",
          " OK . Can you prepare things for the meeting in the meeting room ? Make enough copies of the handouts .",
          " Yes . I am going to show them some slides in the meeting . Can you call Mr . Brown to remind him of the dinner this evening ?",
          " That would be great ! You are really a good employee .",

          " Good morning ! I am Anna Lu . I've come for an interview which was arranged .",
          " Glad to meet you , Mr . White .",
          " Yes . Since I entered college , I have been working at a fast food restaurant as a part-time waitress .",
          " <MASK> .",
          " That's why I applied for this job . Now I am studying Hotel English in my college , and I am quite familiar with the western courtesy and restaurant etiquette . I am sure my public relation skills will leave a strong impression on your customers .",
          " I don't mind that .",
          " When am I supposed to start working ?",
          " Yes , I will . Thank you , Mr . White . Goodbye !",
          " I am a graduate of a technical university and have been employed as a technician with Company or approximately <MASK> .",
          " I am looking for a growth opportunity , which I feel is not available at my current employer . In terms of skills , I am Microsoft certified in Windows XP and several other operating system",
          " I see myself in a management position .",
          " So far it looks like we will be leaving <MASK> late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case .",
          " I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ?",
          " It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . It happens all the time . No need to worry .",
          " For a local paper in York called the York Herald . Actually , I started with them as an intern in the beginning . I was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism , and this seemed like a g",
          " They seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . I ended up staying <MASK> there actually . I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . I really",
          " Yes , that ' s right . My husband and I moved to London , and so I managed to find a position with a National newspaper based in London .",
          " Yes , in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .",
          " Did you send in your Continued Claim Form for the last period ?",
          " You need to be very careful to send that form in <MASK> if you want to get paid .",
          " You should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due . If it hasn ' t been , we will still accept it .",
          " Actually , you cannot mail it in early , as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date .",
          " Your check will arrive a little late .",
          " I hope that you remembered to send in your last Continued Claim Form .",
          " You have to send that form in <MASK> so we that we will know what to pay you .",
          " If it is not more than fourteen days past its due date , then you may still mail it in .",
          " You can ' t mail it in early because you don ' t know , in advance , how much you will be working .",
          " Yes , your check will be a little late in getting to you .",
          " Hello , I called earlier regarding interest rates on loans . Sorry , I just have a couple more questions .",
          " What if I require a loan for a short period of time ?",
          " Say , 6 months ? Or less in fact . I want to repay the loan ASAP ; I don't like debt hanging over my head .",
          " What if I repay it early . Any perks ?",
          " So , the quicker I pay it back , the more I can save in interest ? That's excellent . Thanks so much for your information . I'll come in shortly to take the relevant steps for the loan .",
          " OK , what does that entail ?",
          " Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ?",
          " I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ?",
          " Absolutely , Jenny . Thanks very much , I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today .",
          " I need some info on car loans . Such as payment periods , interest rates , things like that , please .",
          " Yes , I do . I have a Current Account , a credit card and a mortgage with you already .",
          " I plan to repay it within 2 years . And the interest ?",
          " So the rate is variable ? OK , that's fine . How about the frequency of repayment ?",
          " That's nice and easy . Thanks for your time .",
          " I'm going to be studying overseas next year and I'd like some info about suitable loans . To be honest , I'm not even sure if I can get a loan .",
          " Would I have to get my parents to guarantor the loan ?",
          " I see . What about age limitations ?",
          " Got it ! I fit into that category very nicely . That's great ! I'll have a chat with my parents and come back . Thanks very much .",
          " I want to save some US dollars into my account .",
          " Yes , that's what my husband advised me to do . But I'm not sure how long I should save for .",
          " Mmmm ... 2 years does seem like a long time . How about the interest if I save for 6 months ?",
          " That sounds fine to me . Yes , I think 6 months is the way to go .",
          " Hello . Yes , I'm here to redeem a Treasury Note . It's not at the maturity date yet , but it is an emergency .",
          " There you are . As you can see , the maturity isn't up yet .",
          " Oh , really ? No , I wasn't aware of that .",
          " Yes , I'd like to make a deposit .",
          " I prefer time deposit .",
          " RIB deposit .",
          " Yes .",
          " Six months .",
          " Here you are .",
          " Thank you .",
          " We've been looking forward to your visit . It is a great pleasure for us to have you as our guest . It is always more convenient to discuss things face to face .",
          " We've received some similar comments from other Australian firms too .",
          " We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers . As you know , the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial . However , according to our records , the total amount of your order last year was moderate , which does not warrant an agency appointment . Unless you increase the turnover we can hardly appoint you our sole agent .",
          " As far as I remember , we sold about 40,000 pairs last year to you alone . Don't you think this annual turnover is rather conserve - time for a sole agent ?",
          " Let's put it this way . I propose a sole agency agreement for Ladies and gents plastic slippers ( excluding children's ) for a duration of 3 years ; 60,000 pairs to be sold in the first year , 70,000 pairs in the second year , and 80,000 pairs in the third year , the area is to be within the continent of Australia ( excluding any neighboring island ) , commission 5 % .",
          " On the contrary , Mr . London , we value your friendship more than anything else . We both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price . And with the sole agency in your hand , there will be no competition and you can easily control the market , which would naturally result in bigger sales . I'm sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty .",
          " Tomorrow afternoon .",
          " Right over there .",
          " I loved it . I'll take it .",
          " Here you go ?",
          " No I don't .",
          " Not today . Thanks though .",
          " Sure .",
          " Yeah . I was looking at some of your pants , but they are all a bit too long . Do you have alteration services here ?",
          " Great . Thanks for your help .",
          " Yes . I've read it carefully .",
          " No . But the contract stipulates that I will teach 22 hours a week.Will you have thatmany classes for me right away ?",
          " But my salary will be 1100 dollars a month.Will you pay me that much for the first month ? Because , I mean , I won't be working so many hours .",
          " Oh , so I don't sign the contract today . Is that right ?",
          " I can accept that .",
          " Even my health insurance ?",
          " I have a few questions about the free membership .",
          " Is my membership the same as paying club members ? I mean , can I get discounts at club hotels ?",
          " What are bar vouchers ?",
          " But according to the contract , employees get a discount in the restaurant .",
          " So , for now , you want me to keep a copy of the contract.But we won't sign it yet . That right ?",
          " I understand.And according to the terms on the contract , I am happy to accept this job . I look forward to it .",
          " Yes . I've read it carefully .",

          " I was worried you would think it was too far to drive .",
          " I think if you try some more authentic Chinese food , you might understand how we students from Taiwan suffer .",
          " I mean , in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food.So we miss the food in Taiwan too much.Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better .",
          " Yes , even in the winter .",
          " Why not ? I've been craving good food for <MASK> now . I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza !",
          " Don't tease me ! Good food is really important to Chinese !",
          " Yes , all these dishes are different \" dim sum \" dishes.You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America .",
          " Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too.Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment .",
          " No way !",
          " We're going up to the \" new \" Chinatown for dinner . I already know where we're going to go .",
          " No , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast.We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the \" new \" Chinatown .",
          " No , dim sum is more Cantonese style.But of course you can buy it in Taiwan .",
          " I'm a great cook actually . You will see .",
          " I want to leave . We've already been here <MASK> .",
          " I would rather buy them somewhere else .",
          " I don't like shopping in malls . I like shopping on the street . There is more variety .",
          " Alright .",
          " The styles here are too boring for me . I told you . I like street shopping .",
          " Sure I would .",
          " Do they have it in LARGE .",
          " Where is the fitting room ? I don't see it .",
          " Okay , I will try it on .",
          " I look like a nerd .",
          " Well , I don't think it's the best style for me .",
          " Alright . Alright .",
          " Yes , maybe . But I like street shopping . There is more variety . I'm sorry . I just don't like malls .",
          " He's awful ! He telephoned me four times yesterday , and three times the day before yesterday . He telephoned the office yesterday morning and yesterday afternoon . My boss answered the telephone .",
          " He said , Pauline is typing letters . She can't speak to you now ! \" Then I arrived home at six o'clock yesterday evening . He telephoned again . But I didn ' t answer the phone !",
          " Yes , he did . He telephoned at <MASK> .",
          " I said , This is Pauline's mother . Please don ' t telephone my daughter again !",
          " No , he didn't !",
          " Do you have an appointment ?",
          " Yes , we do . I can cut your hair right now if you like.Do you need a shampoo too , or just a haircut ?",
          " Alright . I will have an assistant wet your hair . Then I can cut it.Please step over there.How would you like your hair cut today ?",
          " I recommend you leave it a little long on top.But we should take in the back and sides a bit more . That's more fashionable now .",
          " So I will cut the sides just above the ear . Is that good ?",
          " And do you usually part your hair along here ?",
          " Alright , I know just what to do.Your hair seems quite dry , you know . And I see some split ends .",
          " The problem is the split ends . They make your hair look even more frizzy .",
          " Well , there are two things you can do.First , don't blow-dry your hair for so long after you shower . Let it dry naturally.That is easier on the hair , so you won't get split ends.Second , buy a g",
          " Of course . I have one I can suggest .",
          " The problem is the split ends .",
          " Can I sign up for some classes today ?",
          " I would like to take a driver's course .",
          " Why do I need an appointment ?",
          " Can I do that right now ?",
          " How <MASK> ?",
          " Thanks for all your help .",
          " Actually , it is a 30 - day notice to vacate the premises .",
          " This isn ' t the first time you have been considerably late with the rent . I need to start the procedure to evict you .",
          " This is a notice to inform you that the sheriff will evict you in <MASK> if you do not pay up on your rent .",
          " You can keep the apartment if you stay caught up on your rent . Otherwise , I need to find someone who can make the payments .",
          " Thank you . I will need a cashier ' s check or cash , please .",
          " Oh , hey , no kidding ! I haven't seen you since orientation <MASK> ! So how've you been ? Settling into college life OK ?",
          " Oh , so you're a frat boy now , huh ?",
          " Not much . I'm still living at home and commuting to school . I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about . It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped . The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count .",
          " Yeah , it is , a little bit . I joined the Great Outdoors Club , though , which has been a lot of fun . We've gone on two camping trips already , and I've made some good friends .",
          " Definitely pre-med . What about you ?",
          " OK , take care ! Hey , nice running into you !",
          " Well , you are behind in your rent ; it ' s a <MASK> notice to vacate .",
          " You have been late with your rent several times now . I am filing suit for back rent to protect myself .",
          " This notice is to let you know that you will be evicted by a sheriff if you don ' t make good on your rent .",
          " You can stay if you catch up and stay caught up . Otherwise , I will find another renter .",
          " Thank you . Please make sure that you pay with cash or a cashier ' s check .",
          " It was great . I had a really good time .",
          " Well , I had English from 9 o'clock to 11 o'clock , art from 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock , and math from <MASK> .",
          " To be honest , I liked all of them , except for the math teacher . Though he must be quite young , he seem like an old person . He ' s so boring !",
          " She was great . In today ' s class , she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student . She told us not to arm for exams , and to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing .",
          " She said that she ' s from a small town in the middle of America .",
          " Not everything , but nearly . She speaks very clearly and doesn ' t use very complex words so that it is easy for us to understand her .",
          " Yes ... with flying colors !",
          " It ' s a new phrase that she taught us today . It means that I will not only pass the class , but I will do extremely well !",
          " I hope so .",
          " not today . She said she wanted us to relax tonight instead of doing homework ,",
          " I can help you . How much money do you make per year ?",
          " How long have you been on your current job ?",
          " Do you have any other outside income from rental property or a trust ?",
          " Do you know your credit score ?",
          " By crunching the numbers and putting in your expenses , I estimate that you can afford a house of around five hundred thousand dollars .",
          " There is a formula that can help us figure that out . What is your annual salary ?",
          " What is the length of time that you have worked at the job you have now ?",
          " Do you receive any other income ?",
          " Do you know what your credit score is ?",
          " You are in good shape . Figuring in your other expenses , you can easily afford a house costing seven hundred thousand or maybe even a little more !",
          " I know . I have to prepare the supper for the whole family before I leave .",
          " The housework is really a big problem for me . My husband is on a business trip to the U . S . now and I have to take care of everything myself .",
          " I've asked my parents to live with us for a while , so they can look after her for me while I am at work or in the class .",
          " Me too . Sometimes I do want to give it up . I can't deal with so many things at a time .",
          " It's close coming up at the end of this month . That will be no more than 15 days from now on .",
          " Why don't you take the CPA exam ? You are already a good accountant , having so many years of experience .",
          " I bought it online .",
          " Yes . I buy most of my daily necessities online .",
          " Yes , much better . You can log in a website , browse through many items and categories comfortably at home , order the goods , pay by credit or debit card , and the goods will be delivered to your home .",
          " And you can still go ' window shopping ' just like in a real shopping mall .",
          " Yes , most of the shops are closed at 22:00 or even earlier , but the internet operates 24 hours a day , <MASK> a week , and can be accessed anywhere .",
          " Sure . You can buy almost anything you can think of .",
          " You can catch the 486 .",
          " I believe so .",
          " It only takes <MASK> to an hour .",
          " It's a pretty short trip .",
          " It only gets crowded once it gets to LA .",
          " No problem .",
          " Yup . I have English at 9 in the morning .",
          " Not really . What about you ?",
          " Sure . I need to return some books . They are due today . Besides , I can also read some weekly publications , magazines and newspapers .",
          " That sounds like a good idea . We can chill out a little in such a hot summer . Are you good at swimming ?",
          " Oh , it's almost 9 . I need to hurry . I am running late now . See you after class in front of the library then . Bye !",
          " Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant .",
          " They ' re really running you into the ground . Why don ' t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere .",
          " Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant .",
          " They ' re really running you into the ground . Why don ' t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere .",

          " They ' re really running you into the ground . Why don ' t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere .",
          " Now that you mention it , I'm getting a little bumed-out from studying nonstop , too . Listening to some music for a while would suit me just fine .",
          " You sure have a lot of discs here .",
          " To tell you the truth , I'm strictly into classical music . You don't happen to have any Bach or Mozart , do you ?",
          " Well , speaking of history , let's get back to the books.We ' Ve got an exam tomorrow , remember ?",
          " Hi Julie . Yeah . I've been on a diet for a couple of months now .",
          " Thanks for noticing .",
          " I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating . With a combination of eating better and exercising , I managed to lose 15 pounds in <MASK> .",
          " Mostly on how to exercise , but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits . Instead of eating 3 times a day , she told me to eat 5 times a day .",
          " Actually , I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically , it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate .",
          " You don't need to lose weight .",
          " Ah ... but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet .",
          " No problem .",
          " I know , but I don't have a choice , my boss has complete control over our work schedules . I haven't made it out of the office before <MASK> a single day this week .",
          " No , not exactly , I'm working for minimum wage.And they don't give extra pay for overtime . Overtime is our own time .",
          " They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it's not much of an incentive . They give us a bonus of ten dollars .",
          " I would , but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for .",
          " Oh , I'd love to . But we're going to clean our dormitory . I can't be absent .",
          " In fact , our dormitory is much worse than they can be described .",
          " You'll get used to it gradually .",
          " Yes , we do . That's why we have a cleaning <MASK> .",
          " I can hardly make ends meet these days .",
          " my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .",
          " definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .",
          " is that inflation ?",
          " has the government taken some measures to curb it ?",
          " but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .",
          " how ?",
          " sounds a good idea .",
          " Ten more minutes , mom .",
          " It's already 3 <MASK> .",
          " We are leaving on our science field trip at 8 a . m . next Monday . Do you have something to write that down on ?",
          " That will be on the second of December . Be there half an hour early to get your bags on the bus . Do you understand ?",
          " The bus will bring you back 6 days later on December 8th . Is someone coming to get you ?",
          " We will be leaving the campground at <MASK> and arrive at our campus at 8 p.m.Any more questions .",
          " I put all of that information in the packet . I'll give you another copy if you need one . See you on Monday !",

          " What do you think we can see during the festival ?",
          " I'd like to take the one that goes to the Wild Animal Park .",
          " Wow , must be interesting to watch dragon boats compete a-gainst one another on the city river .",
          " What happened that you didn't get it done ?",
          " Well , you had <MASK> ; couldn't you have fit it in on another day ?",
          " Either way , I only allow one missed assignment per semester . When will you be turning the make-up in ?",
          " Fine , but it cannot happen again if you want an \u201c A \u201d in the class .",
          " Remember that you are in college now , not high school .",
          " I would like to return some books .",
          " Here you go .",
          " Yeah . I totally forgot they were due .",
          " How much are the late fees ?",
          " I have to pay 25 cents a day ?",
          " That shouldn ' t be a problem .",
          " Really ? Why ? What happened ?",
          " Oh , no .",
          " So what did you do ?",
          " You what ?",
          " Wow , good for you .",
          " Oh , no !",
          " You really have bad luck , don't you ?",
          " I need to return these books .",
          " Here they are .",
          " I forgot they were due .",
          " How much is the late fee ?",
          " So I have to pay 25 cents for each day the books are late ?",
          " That ' s a lot of money .",
          " When does the library close ?",
          " Does it close at that time every day ?",
          " Is the library open on Saturdays ?",
          " What time do you open and close on Saturday ?",
          " Okay . Thank you very much .",
          " No , that ' s all . Thanks .",
          " I think that , as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure , it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people , and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced .",
          " I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long . A lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy . Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world .",
          " I'd suggest you not give out too much personal information , like your home address , until after several dates . Just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger .",
          " Well , for a site like ecrush.com , since their debut in <MASK> , of the 1.5 million people who have joined ecrush.com , 300000 have actually matched .",
          " Yes , the couple that I highlighted at today's show met on Match.com and they're getting married this summer .",
          " Thanks . It's a lot better than mine , and it's new .",
          " We're going to visit my sister in the city .",
          " About a year ago . She lives in an apartment on 3rd street , across from the public library .",
          " Oh , we're not driving . We're going to take the subway . The subway only takes about 20 minutes .",
          " I take the subway to work everyday , so I'm used to it now .",
          " Yes , she's lived there for <MASK> .",
          " I know what you mean . It's hard to find anything that's reasonable now .",
          " See you later .",
          " I have no idea yet . Do you have any suggestions ?",
          " I'd like to .",
          " OK , will do !",
          " Yes , how much is the teapot ?",
          " I'm afraid I haven't got enough money on me .",
          " What's the time now ?",
          " I want to know at what time you close .",
          " Oh , that's great ! Thank you .",
          " Can't bear it , right ? I've been there before . I'll feel uncomfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages , like there is something missing .",
          " Actually , this is a kind of addiction called ' infomania ' or ' information overload ' .",
          " Yes , it is . Do you consider a frequent check of your in-coming emails to be an integral part of your working day ?",
          " Do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time ?",
          " Do you open all your IM tools whenever you're using a computer ?",
          " Now I can tell you're definitely addicted to the overflow of information",
          " Hi , this is Susan Smith . I ' m calling about my appointment with Doctor Brown today at 3",
          " I got the flu . I have a fever and a headache . Can I cancel my appointment ?",
          " Oh , there ' s a charge ? Why ?",
          " I see . That ' s ok . I ' ll pay .",
          " No . Not right now . When I feel better I ' ll call you again .",
          " Thank you .",
          " Janice , I found you stole my vegetables at <MASK> . Is that true ?",
          " It is so hard to prevent them from being stolen . I also got something this morning .",
          " I stole many from Fred's farm , and from yours . I planned to have a dog on farm .",
          " I could not agree with you more . For us , there are so many unhappy things and I am so bored ; however , I got lots of fun from stealing .",
          " But we still need to go back to it . Don't overdo it .",
          " Hi Pete , how do you know my name ?",
          " Oh Andrea , the Spanish girl ?",
          " I met her last week at a party . Anyway , you must be from the United States ?",
          " Oh , I am from London as well .",
          " In Wimbledon - quite close to the tennis courts actually . Which is very nice because I love tennis .",
          " That would be lovely . But now let's go and get a drink .",
          " I was born in Beijing , but I spent most of my childhood in London .",
          " I had a pretty strict upbringing , and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me .",
          " My parents wanted me to stay in Beijing , but I decided to go back to England . I graduated from University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a degree in Cross Culture Communication .",
          " I am a journalist . I write for China Daily .",
          " No , I didn ' t . I started working at a university in London but as time went by , I found I did not really like my job . I decided to explore other fields . Journalism is great fit for me as well as a challenge .",
          " Yes , I came to Beijing <MASK> looking for new opportunities . I was lucky because my friend introduced me to my current company .",
          " Really ? That's so great . Congratulations .",
          " That's really exciting . How many months are you pregnant ?",
          " Are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ?",
          " Maybe it's more exciting not knowing .",
          " There are so many things you have to prepare for .",
          " It really must be an exciting time for you guys .",
          " Well , it's OK , I suppose . We get about the equivalent of <MASK> ' salary .",
          " Maybe . But you'd be amazed at how little's left after the credit companies have deducted their share from my account .",
          " Well , you're lucky that you're still able to make your payments . I missed a credit payment last month . Now my bank account's overdrawn , and the company is threatening to take back my purchases .",
          " A new home health monitor .",
          " You're kidding !",
          " That's something else ! Maybe I'll return it to them .",
          " Stop fussing ! It is said that the training is important for our newcomers . And my company also informs me to attend the training next week .",
          " I disagree with you . Companies usually make a workable and reasonable plan for the trainings , so as to improve new comers ' understanding of the company and its rules in short time . Through the training , we get to know many things , such as the corporate culture and spirit . Our newcomers can really grasp the essence of the company",
          " What are you reading ?",
          " Didn't he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? He got arrested for that , didn't he ?",
          " If I remember , he got off with a light sentence . Something like three years in a minimum-security prison .",
          " I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He's still a millionaire .",
          " I know . And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for <MASK> .",
          " So what's Michael Milliken up to these days ?",
          " What is a sixties party ?",
          " That sounds like fun . But where can I get clothes that old ?",
          " Good idea . Can I bring some music from that period too ?",
          " Don't tell me you have a record player !",
          " Well , I am a bit out of shape . I'm thinking about getting some exercises to keep fit .",
          " So what do you provide ?",
          " How can you get that done ?",
          " What else ?",
          " Sounds pretty good . What about the charge ?",
          " Maybe <MASK> . Just have a try first . Not too tough at the beginning .",
          " I know but I have no choice . My stomach just keeps crying for more and more .",
          " I've been going to the gym these days . The exercise makes me hungry all the time .",
          " Don't pull my leg .",
          " Surely not . I can feel the results . I'm starting to feel different now .",
          " I'm planning to meet my personal trainer to have the work-out plan fixed .",
          " Your father is a bit too timid . He even doesn't know how to introduce himself .",
          " Girl , don't make fun of your Daddy . But I can introduce him to my personal trainer . Maybe <MASK> he will be a fitness freak instead of a cough potato .",
          " It's not cheesy ! It's romantic . When it first came out , I saw it in the theaters five times in one week .",
          " Alright , maybe it's a little bit cheesy . But come on , isn't it fun to go to a cheap flick once in a while ?",
          " Haha , that's definitely a cheesy movie too . Did you watch it over and over again ?",
          " That's a good idea . You'd better hurry up before they've filled all classes . Many people are learning how to drive now .",
          " I am not sure . You can search for them on the Internet .",
          " Let me see . teetee Training School , summer program , 3,000 Yuan , learn how to drive within one month , and get driver's license within <MASK> .",
          " I think so . Let's see the next one , 3,500 Yuan , summer program . Forget it .",
          " Search on the Internet then , see if we can find something more about it .",
          " Don't worry . Let's check out some other schools .",
          " Yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well .",
          " Oh , yes , he is <MASK> older than me . He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often .",
          " His son is coming as well . He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here .",
          " No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them .",
          " Oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . They went to New Zealand last year and loved it .",
          " My parents are already here . My brother and nephew are arriving on Monday .",
          " Yes , I \u2018 m just reading them myself . It ' s been a great competition . We got gold medals in three events .",
          " We won the men ' s high jump and the women ' s 1500 meters .",
          " The woman who won the 1500 meters also broke the world record by <MASK> .",
          " A Russian man broke the discus record by a centimeters . Out best athlete broke his personal best in the long jump , but it only got him third place .",
          " Was he disqualified ?",
          " OK . It falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month . It is said that there is a beautiful goddess Chang'E on the moon who had eaten some sort of elixir and had to depart her husband . She is always expecting to see her husband again . So , later we have the traditional idea that when there is the full moon , it is time for the family members to come together .",
          " You are right . In China , ' round ' is an auspicious word . The moon cakes are in round shape .",
          " It was not in the past . But from 2008 , we can enjoy a <MASK> holiday for this festival .",
          " What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ' t you know what day it is ?",
          " It ' s only the day when the world ' s biggest sporting event is kicking off .",
          " The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ' s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ' s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country , and all .",
          " This is bigger than the Super Bowl , man ! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other <MASK> and fight to win that trophy . They first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each group having 4 teams . The top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarter final sand semifinals .",
          " Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ' s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will become the next champion . So far Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt ; they ' re really good !",
          " Whatever dude , I ' m going to go watch the opening match .",
          " These are my roses . The roses have been in flower for a week .",
          " Yes , you are right . I love flowers and hence have taken to growing them . I take care of my flowers every day as if they are my good friends .",
          " Oh , I see . People who don't understand the nature of flowers won't be able to grow them well . I can help you learn more if you want to plant flowers <MASK> . In this way you need not be afraid of your own sweet flower-garden's being neglected .",
          " Excellent . How many would you like ?",
          " You need to fill out this form , please .",
          " That will be no problem , sir .",
          " Very good , sir . Your order will be ready in one week .",
          " No problem , sir . But it will cost you extra .",
          " It seems to be . How about you today ?",
          " OK , I'll find the time to relax soon .",
          " OK . Do you think we can go buy a newspaper first ?",
          " Are we going to walk or drive ?",
          " The weather is good now , but I think it's suppose to rain this afternoon .",
          " No , he's still sleeping .",
          " Yeah , he didn't come home until 12:00 AM .",
          " I hope so too . I'll give him a call when we get there .",
          " It's straight down this road on the left , next to the museum . It takes <MASK> .",
          " A man is pursuing me . He was my schoolmate in college , and he has been carrying a torch for me for three years .",
          " Yes , I do like him .",
          " You know that I have had a series of miserable relationships . Last summer , I fell in love with John . But the romance blossomed for six or <MASK> , and then wilted .",
          " Maybe you are right .",
          " Yeah , I went over the figures this morning . We're finally started making money again !",
          " not only our annual sales brake a record , but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well . After a <MASK> slump , we finally back in the black .",
          " I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution , and partly because of our new marketing strategy . Because of the new advertising campaign , we have become the top sellers in the field .",
          " Let's hope it is !",
          " I met him through a computer bulletin board .",
          " It was one I used down at the local coffee house called the San Francisco Net . It's been around since around 1991 .",
          " You ought to . One dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time . A Chat session links you with cappuccino sippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network .",
          " That's the whole point . All your inhibitions disappear because you can ' t see the other person . This network allows you to talk to people whom you normally wouldn ' t talk to .",
          " You can do that . A private session lets two people talk alone . This techno-chat program lets you talk about anything with everybody , without prejudice because you can ' t see them .",
          " That's fine with me , but we'll have to get there early . Because after <MASK> , there is always a long line .",
          " It sure is .",
          " No , I wasn't . I came here in 1992 .",
          " I was seventeen .",
          " No , because my English wasn't very good . I studied English for <MASK> first .",
          " Thanks . Your English is pretty good , too .",
          " Hi . I bought one of your vacuums from spend-wart . It ' s broken now .",
          " I think so . I bought it four months ago .",
          " Okay . The model number is 6594 - c .",
          " 906 Ottawa street . My name is David Yang . My phone number is 713-786-0234 .",
          " Could you tell me where the office is located ?",
          " Oh , I know that place . It ' s only <MASK> drive .",
          " All right . Thank you very much for your help .",
          " Yes , it's far quicker and less complicated .",
          " Really ?",
          " Yes , and <MASK> a week .",
          " Follow me , please .",
          " No , you don't have to .",
          " August 1st .",
          " Yes , we do.My parents prepare dinner for me .",
          " We sing \" Happy Birthday \" at the party and have birthday cakes .",
          " Well , I don't know .",
          " So the ' Happy Birthday ' song has been popular since then ?",
          " Thank you , Bob ! This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many , a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world . In Switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the Alps . Fortunately , no one was injured . Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled . Moving to to Latin American , Ecuador has suffered a <MASK> drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country . In Chile , a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region . Losses are reported to be in the billions . Authorities have not yet released an official statement .",
          " I ' m afraid not , Bob . One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted , causing major floods and landslides in the region . Meanwhile , Mexico ' s coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America , affecting Honduras , Guatemala and Panama . That ' s all the news we have for today , but stay tuned for updates on the six o ' clock news . Back to you Bob .",
          " What ? Why do we have to do that ?",
          " I see . That ' s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !",
          " That ' s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for <MASK> , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ' s like we went back in time !",
          " Morning Sally ! What's up ? you seem in a hurry !",
          " Don't worry , I'll drive you .",
          " How are your cases coming along ?",
          " Wow , Good for you.It sounds like a lot of work . I'm proud of you ! Is this the right building ?",
          " You're welcome.Good luck , bye !",

          " Why ? We just got here .",
          " 12",
          " Yes .",
          " But why is it too late ? It's Saturday night.You have nothing to do tomorrow . Why not stay out and drink with us ?",
          " Yes , I was . And I like living here.People know how to party here . In Taipei , some people know how to party.But here , everyone does .",
          " They're smoking pot . Don't worry about it .",
          " Yes , it is .",
          " Don't worry about it . It is true that pot is illegal in America.But the laws aren't as strict as in Taiwan.If people are arrested , and they have a little pot in their possession , they don't go to jail . They just have to pay a fine .",
          " Yes .",
          " I tried it a couple times . But I don't like it . I like alcohol better.Don ' t worry about them , though . If you don't want to smoke pot , you don't have to .",
          " That's alright . But you really should have another drink.People will probably start dancing soon .",
          " You had two drinks at <MASK> . C'mon , Ann , you are in an American university now ! You have to learn how to drink .",
          " It is . We study hard all week.And then , on the weekend , we party hard . That's the best way to live .",
          " it ' s so sad . They had been together for only <MASK> . Do you know what the matter was ?",
          " really ? I ' m very surprised . He doesn ' t look like a guy who ' d ever do that sort of thing , right ?",
          " maybe it is for the best . They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .",
          " he is an extrovert while she is an introvert . He likes parties while she hates them .",
          " anyway , she was right to end things and she deserves better .",
          " no , I don ' t think so . I know Mary . Once she makes a decision , she won ' t change her mind .",
          " so do I .",
          " I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year .",
          " we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec",
          " tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ?",
          " no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know .",
          " great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain .",
          " Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us .",
          " I want to buy a new camcorder for my trip this summer .",
          " not really . I thought I'd just have a look today .",
          " sure . I'd like to see the smallest camcorder that you have first .",
          " it's very light . That would be good . How is the battery life ?",
          " can you also take still photos with this ?",
          " how about night vision ? Can you use it in the dark ?",
          " that's not bad at all . How's the microphone ? Does it pick up much sound ?",
          " how does that compare with other models ?",
          " I guess you can't have everything , can you ?",
          " everything's great . And you ?",

          " Let's get start . What kinds of things do you have in mind ? If you let us know the requirements you have from the very beginning , we can work through each one until we can come to an agreement .",
          " Huh ... I think 7 % is little high that might be hard to do . How about this ? We'll give you a discount of 4 % , but you can have 90 days credits .",
          " No , you have to take care of the insurance . But we are willing to pay the half transport . Can you accept that ?",
          " But you'll have <MASK> to pay your bill and I'll tell you what ... I'll also throw in the discount of 10 % on your up front deposit .",
          " That's great . Thank you for making this concession . I accept .",
          " Good . Now that the price is decided on , we can discuss the packaging .",
          " Carton ?",
          " Could you use wooden cases instead ?",
          " I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for ocean transportation .",
          " All right . Carton or no carton , the packaging must be waterproof as well as strong enough to stand shock and rough handling .",
          " That's right . As soon as I get home , I'll see about the opening of the letter of credit .",
          " No problem . That can be done . I understand you'll ship the goods before the end of May ?",

          " I see . Here ' s a pamphlet about our home insurance policy . We ' Ve named our policy \u201d umbrella \u201d . May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live ? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are .",
          " Let me just check that on my computer . Oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . The other thing to take into account is deductibles .",
          " It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit .",
          " If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less .",

          " You know what ? I don ' t really need the money . Thanks anyways !",
          " Yes . I've read it carefully .",
          " No . But the contract stipulates that I will teach 22 hours a week.Will you have thatmany classes for me right away ?",
          " But my salary will be 1100 dollars a month.Will you pay me that much for the first month ? Because , I mean , I won't be working so many hours .",
          " Oh , so I don't sign the contract today . Is that right ?",
          " I can accept that .",
          " Even my health insurance ?",
          " I have a few questions about the free membership .",
          " Is my membership the same as paying club members ? I mean , can I get discounts at club hotels ?",
          " What are bar vouchers ?",
          " But according to the contract , employees get a discount in the restaurant .",
          " So , for now , you want me to keep a copy of the contract.But we won't sign it yet . That right ?",
          " I understand.And according to the terms on the contract , I am happy to accept this job . I look forward to it .",

          " Blah ... What's that ?",
          " No problem . But , the postage is much higher than the regular package .",
          " OK . All the registered airmail packages can be received in 5 working days .",
          " It's 500 dollars .",
          " Sure ! Please just fill in your I . D . number and ways to contact you here .",
          " You had better include that because it is easier for the mailmen to find the correct mailing address .",
          " Here is your receipt . Contact us if your friend still doesn't receive the package after 5 work days .",
          " Hello Dr Peters . Just fine thank you . Ricky and I are here for his vaccines .",
          " What about Rubella and Mumps ?",
          " OK , great . Doctor , I think I also may need a Tetanus booster . Last time I got it was maybe <MASK> !",
          " Sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality .",
          " To begin with , I have to use chopsticks .",
          " Certainly . After all , I've been here for <MASK> . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Chinese dinner table .",
          " Anything strange about that ?",
          " Oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks .",
          " Dude , what are you talking about ? Only girls do that .",
          " True . So what do they do to you at your beauty spa ?",
          " That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in . In any case , I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day .",
          " Uh ... no .",
          " I think families everywhere have changed a lot in <MASK> .",
          " Well , in the past , three or four generations would live together under the same roof . Nowadays , living in the same city as one's relatives is becoming rare .",
          " Would you consider having your parents live with you when they get older ?",
          " That's very respectable , but I could never live with my parents . I usually only see them at our christmas celebration \u2014 and that's enough !",
          " Two of my sisters still live at home , even though they have already graduated from university and have good jobs . They enjoy spending their free time with my parents . I guess in that respect , I'm the black sheep of the family .",
          " They're always asking me to come home , but I think our relationship is better if we keep a distance from each other . Whenever we see each other , all we do is fight .",
          " It's a furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus .",
          " It's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it .",
          " No , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first <MASK> we pay 1/2 month's rent each month .",
          " No , it's all included . Besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here .",
          " That's the bad thing---the contract ends in June , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon .",
          " Not yet . I'm hoping we'll be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer .",
          " We just moved in yesterday , actually .",
          " It's great ! Unfortunately , we're going to spend a fortune doing everything up .",
          " It's <MASK> . It has a lot of history !",
          " It's just off of the ring road .",
          " It's bigger than our last one . I've got flowers in the front , and fruits , vegetables and a fish pond in the back .",
          " Oh , yes . Our windows let plenty of natural light in . They've also got wonderful views of the park behind our house .",
          " Right now , there are three bedrooms , two barrooms , a kitchen , a sitting room , a dining room , and a living room . We're hoping to add on a green room and a guest bedroom . In fact , when the guest bedroom is ready , you should come and stay with us for a weekend .",
          " That depends . What is it ?",
          " I'd love to help you out , but I'm a bit short on cash this month as well . I had to get a new engine put into my car , and that ate up my savings .",
          " Let's see , I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend . I can only spare about $ 20 . I would give you more if I had it , I just don't have much money to my name right now .",
          " That'd be great . Thanks ! What time should I come over ?",
          " See you then !",
          " I'm sorry about that , sir . I'll get you another one .",
          " I see . Maybe I can offer you a credit note .",
          " OK , sir . I'll see what I can do .",
          " I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .",
          " I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ?",
          " Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?",
          " I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .",
          " We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .",
          " Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .",
          " Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible .",
          " I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .",
          " Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .",
          " Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for <MASK> . Then we'll turn it on again .",
          " Yeah , you get the TV to yourself while I spend my nights surfing the Net for missing classmates .",
          " I guess . Don't you have reunions in Taiwan ?",
          " Ours are for everyone that graduated in the same year .",
          " Honey , you really forgot about it ? Think it over . It's a candlelight dinner .",
          " It's our wedding anniversary , honey . How can you forget about it ?",
          " Of course . I almost missed my own wedding .",
          " Oh , really ! It looks so different . Our old place turns into a brand new place .",
          " I can never forget that . I bought you five candies , but I was so anxious that I forgot to give them to you . You didn't get them until we parted . Then they had already melted down for I held them the whole time .",
          " You are the one I should thank . You've done really great job .",
          " There is a man-made fishing pond nearby . So , What do you think of going fishing there ?",
          " Patience , boy . A watched pot never boils . We shall get out fishing stuff first and make some baits , too .",
          " I don't think fish would like them . Instead , they love earth worms .",
          " OK . I think that's enough for today . Let's go .",
          " That's because you're talking to me all the time . Be patient , or there will be no chance to have sashimi for dinner today .",
          " I suppose she did . Be quiet . There is a fish on the hook . Here it is . Look , a big one .",
          " Great idea . But the fact is we have no barbecue with us . Moreover , the sashimi will be great . So why do we bother to waste time on barbecuing the fish ?",
          " Yes sir , just a minute , please . I ' ll check with the kitchen . Thank you for waiting . It takes <MASK> , I ' m afraid .",
          " I see .",
          " Well sir , yes . How about this stew ? We can serve you at once .",
          " Excellent . Come in please . The washing machine is in the bathroom upstairs . It keeps breaking down .",
          " <MASK> . I ' Ve tried to use it since then . Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn ' t . it ' s very frustrating .",
          " Yes , it ' s still under warranty . Over the last few weeks , it ' s also been making a high-pitch noise when it ' s in use .",
          " What ' s wrong with it ?",
          " That ' s great . Thanks very much . Would you like a cup of tea or coffee ?",
          " Yes ?",
          " Oh , did you ?",
          " Yes , of course . Will you come with receipt ?",
          " Until <MASK> madam . We are looking forward to seeing you .",
          " How about two inches ?",
          " I think that will over-process your hair , you should wait <MASK> .",
          " Great . My assistant will wash your hair , and then I'll be back to help you .",
          " Cats are well know for being more independent than dogs . How old is your cat now ? you ' Ve had her longer than we ' Ve had our dog .",
          " Yes . He ' s so energetic . We take him out to the park every morning and evening . I think he ' d be happy to stay there all day !",
          " Your cat spends most of the day outdoors ' , right ? Do you kino where she goes ?",
          " Have you ever thought about having another pet ?",
          " Yes , I have a spare room .",
          " Would you come here in <MASK> ? We're right in the middle of dinner .",
          " Yes , it has two bedrooms . That's convenient .",
          " 2,500 yuan a month .",
          " I'm afraid you are beginning to look a little overweight . You really need to stop smoking . That's the main reason you're unhealthy .",
          " Why don't you try smoking one cigarette less each day ? How many do you smoke each day now ?",
          " Ok . So for <MASK> , reduce the number you smoke by one a day . At the end of the month , you'll have quit . You should also buy a tracksuit and go jogging every morning . You don't need to jog far .",
          " Be careful when you go jogging . Don't put yourself under too much stress . You're still a smoker shouldn't do too much exercises in your condition .",
          " Good idea . Remember to eat healthily too . The trainers at the fitness centre will be able to advise you on your diet .",
          " I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ' m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself .",
          " Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ' t need to be replaced .",
          " As I hadn ' t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me <MASK> altogether .",
          " You ' ll be lucky ! However , I ' ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself .",
          " I have a flat tyre .",
          " 489 3362 1978 .",
          " Eve .",
          " It's July 16,2009 .",
          " It's on the west street , near Royal Hotel .",
          " I was going west .",
          " BMW 530 .",
          " It's red .",
          " SAY 201 .",
          " Yes . Where would you like to go ?",
          " Of course .",
          " Well . That depends on traffic , you know . It's pretty heavy this afternoon .",
          " I'll try . Where exactly is your friend waiting ?",
          " You've got it .",
          " Here we are , Central Park !",
          " Well , it's $ 12 .",
          " Thank you .",
          " Oh , hi , Mary , come on in . Any problem ?",
          " Great . I forgot to ask you , though . How long did you want the place ?",
          " Oh , well , that might be a problem . I usually only sign one year leases .",
          " Well , if it ' s not a problem . Then here you go .",
          " Of course .",
          " Yeah , and don ' t worry about the security deposit . If everything ' s all right when you move out , you ' ll get it back .",
          " Yes . Thanks . You can move your stuff in tomorrow .",
          " It ' s a skill . What can I say ? I don ' t know why , I just have a long routine .",
          " Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ' t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ' s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ' ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ' s another <MASK> or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine .",
          " Not funny .",
          " They'll be ready by this afternoon .",
          " Is that right ? We're very sorry .",
          " I'm afraid we can't return it by <MASK> .",
          " Yes , we'll do so .",
          " Fine , just get it ! We have been shopping for furniture for five hours ! I ' m so tired !",
          " Fine ! I am going to go home and drop off this nightstand , coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things .",
          " While you are at it can you pick out a nice recliner ? I really want one so I can watch TV .",
          " How about this floor lamp ?",
          " We still need to find an armoire and a dresser .",
          " Great ! Pick me up in about an hour because I think I ' ll also get a bean bag and a dining set .",
          " Recliner ? In my beautifully decorated living room ? I don ' t think so !",
          " Yes , sir.Just a minute , please , I'll check with the kitchen .",
          " We have an appointment in half an hour .",
          " Do you have anything else I can have instead ?",
          " I'll take beef stew , then .",
          " No , we don't .",
          " Just two people .",
          " We prefer non-smoking section .",
          " How long a wait do you think there ' ll be ?",
          " Ok , we'll wait a while .",
          " Thank you .",
          " Well , I think I'd like to have a tomato sausage soup first . And the same for him , please .",
          " One goblet of red wine and one bottle of beer please .",
          " What special kind of desserts do you have ?",
          " Well , I think we will order after we finish the main course .",
          " That's funny . My watch always loses ten minutes a day .",
          " I am serious . Every morning I set my watch by the radio , but it still loses ten minutes .",
          " Throw it away and buy a new one .",
          " So you put your watch back <MASK> every day ?",
          " Why bother ? Just buy a new watch . It doesn't cost much . Besides , I just can ' t put up with this thing any more .",
          " No . The things are too expensive there for me . I can't afford it .",
          " Really ? That's wonderful . Can you wait a second ? I need to change .",
          " I will . Do you think we can get something really nice and cheap ? I mean this is the last day .",
          " Should we ask Cindy to come along ? She saw the evening gown made of silk last month that she wanted to buy very much . She didn't buy it of course . It would cost her <MASK> ' salary .",
          " When ?",
          " Oh ? Isn't that like her .",
          " All right , all right . I am ready to go . Let's go !",
          " You are going to have a huge bill .",
          " Don't you wanna get it fixed now ?",
          " Well , if you need anything , just let me know .",
          " You sure have bad luck these days .",
          " There are many interesting places you should be sure to see . One problem is transportation , however . Because the city is very old , the roads are narrow and congested . If you only have three or four days to visit , you don't want to spend them waiting in traffic in a cab . I suggest you take the subway .",
          " No worries , there's a subway station at the conference center itself , and a shuttle from your hotel to the conference center that takes only <MASK> . When you do your personal sightseeing , you can first take the shuttle to the conference center , then hop on the metro .",
          " You can get a daily pass that will allow you to travel unlimited for the whole day for about 6 dollars . Otherwise , you can pay by trip , which is about 50 cents to 2 dollars each trip , depending on how far you go .",
          " No , no ... . it's very hard to get lost . There are two lines , one that goes in a circle , the other that is straight . If you get lost , there are always subway attendants that can help you find your way .",
          " Oh , it runs <MASK> . You must have missed it , when you came here . It should be here any minute now .",
          " Yes , I do . You can go to the Transport Department to get yourself a bus schedule and a bus route map .",
          " Hi , I would like to send this package to China , and these postcards as well .",
          " How much is this going to cost ?",
          " What ' s the difference ?",
          " I see . Well , there ' s no rush . Please send it via priority mail . Please be extra careful , the contents of the package are fragile .",
          " I bought it online .",
          " yes . I buy most of my daily necessities online .",
          " yes , much better . You can log in a website , browse through many items and categories comfortably at home , order the goods , pay by credit or debit card , and the goods will be delivered to your home .",
          " and you can still go \" window shopping \" just like in a real shopping mall .",
          " yes , most of the shops are closed at 22 or even earlier , but the internet operates 24 hours a day , <MASK> a week , and can be accessed anywhere .",
          " sure . You can buy almost anything you can think of .",
          " Just a minute . I am as busy as a bee right now ... Ok , I am done . What can I do for you ?",
          " Well , keep you chin up ! I ' ll try to help you . Where are you going ?",
          " Yes , no problem . You walk down this street . You turn left at the first intersection . Walk along that road , turn right at the corner . After that , you make a left-hand turn at the first traffic light . The Royal Hotel is on your right side .",
          " Yeah , I think so . I think the hotel is right across the street from a post office . It is as plain as the hump on a camel . You can't miss it .",
          " Yeah , it ' s gonna take you a while if you go by foot . I ' d say it's about a 30 - minute uphill walk . You have to be as strong as a lion to make it .",
          " Well , you could take a bus there , but you would have to transfer buses twice . A taxi would probably be a lot quicker .",
          " Not too long . It should take <MASK> by taxi .",
          " You are welcome .",
          " Um . Ten ?",
          " I know , but it wasn ' t my fault ! I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before ten , but she wouldn ' t leave the party !",
          " Mom ! That is so unfair !",
          " What ! For being a couple of hours late ? You have to be kidding !",
          " Oh , yes , please . But you are just closing , aren't you ?",
          " I shall not keep you long then . It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week .",
          " Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ?",
          " Oh , you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale , a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them .",
          " I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday .",
          " May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ?",
          " Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ' d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot .",
          " Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color .",
          " There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness , they haven't been sold . And thank you so much for being so patient with me . Yes , those are the ones .",
          " Well , I felt like baking , so I made some muffins .",
          " Sure , I'll take mine , sunny side up .",
          " You know , my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for <MASK> . It drove my mom crazy !",
          " You ' re so picky sometimes .",
          " I said sunny side up ! How many times do I have to tell you .",
          " Hello , Claire . This is Mick .",
          " Fine , thanks . And you ?",
          " Good . Listen . I'm phoning because I want to invite you to a party . At our Newhouse . And . .",
          " Yes . We've moved . That's why we're giving the party . Can you come ?",
          " This Saturday evening .",
          " Until <MASK> . But you don't have to stay that long.Well ? What about it ?",
          " Nothing . I mean , don't bring anything . It isn't necessary .",
          " Just bring yourself ! I'm looking forward to seeingyou again . It's been a long time !",
          " Come any time after eight . All right ? .",
          " Bye ! See you on Saturday evening .",
          " I'm afraid we'll be late for the party .",
          " Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch !",
          " Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired .",
          " I think <MASK> by bus .",
          " Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus .",
          " I hope so , do you have a shopping skirts ? something i could wear working in a ban ?",
          " It is nice , may i try it on ?",
          " Does this fashion really fit my figure ?",
          " Oh , thank you , just shows you what is going to max jemmy redate for all this body .",
          " I thought you recognize she from there .",
          " Yes , it is really good for my arms and shoulders , ok , i will take this one , do you have a blue in this size style ? i want one for my sister , she has a great figure and she loves blue .",
          " Oh , good , do you have a discount for two ?",
          " That is great , i will take this two , how much is that ?",
          " Ok , 90 dollars , do you accept this card ?",
          " Debit card .",
          " No , thanks .",

          " Thanks , byebye .",
          " Yes , yes I did . Please come in ! I ' m so glad you came ! This old house is falling apart ! Come on into the bathroom . See , here , there ' s water leaking everywhere !",
          " Oh , that must be because of my <MASK> daughter . She is always flushing things down the toilet . You know how kids are .",
          " That would be great ! Is it expensive ?",
          " I ' m fine , thank you .",
          " If I could , I would like to view the apartment sometime today .",
          " Why is that ?",
          " I would like to make one right now if I can .",
          " Can we do it at 6 o ' clock ?",
          " All right . I ' ll see you on Friday .",
          " we just moved in yesterday , actually .",
          " it's great ! Unfortunately , we're going to spend a fortune doing everything up .",
          " it's <MASK> . It has a lot of history !",
          " it's just off of the ring road .",
          " it's bigger than our last one . I've got flowers in the front , and fruits , vegetables and a fish pond in the back .",
          " oh , yes . Our windows let plenty of natural light in . They've also got wonderful views of the park behind our house .",
          " right now , there are three bedrooms , two barrooms , a kitchen , a sitting room , a dining room , and a living room . We're hoping to add on a green room and a guest bedroom . In fact , when the guest room i",
          " excellent . Come in please . The washing machine is in the bathroom upstairs . It keeps breaking down .",
          " <MASK> . I ' Ve tried to use it since then . Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn ' t . it ' s very frustrating .",
          " yes , it ' s still under warranty . Over the last few weeks , it ' s also been making a high - pitch noise when it ' s in use .",
          " what ' s wrong with it ?",
          " that ' s great . Thanks very much . Would you like a cup of tea or coffee ?",
          " are you looking for somewhere for two people ?",
          " yes , there are several place available in that price range near the university . do you have any other requirements ?",
          " how many rooms do you need in the flat ?",
          " ok . i've got a list of place that fit your requirements . let's just go through them . the first on the list costs 80 pounds a month , but it's on a noisy street and it's a little far from t",
          " it's about two miles away . that might be a little far to walk . here's one that's about half a mile from the campus . the cost is 100 pounds a month and it's on a small street , just off a",
          " of course . i'm not very busy at the moment . if you can wait for about 15 or <MASK> . i can take you there .",
          " But I'm not sleepy , Mum . Can I stay and watch more TV ?",
          " I know . But I promise I won't be sleepy tomorrow . I work really hard .",
          " Oh , I nearly forgot the exams .",
          " Yeah , I guess so . Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow .",
          " I know you're right . School is more important than TV . Can I watch one more show , then go to bed .",
          " In America , most children start primary school at the age of five .",
          " Kindergarten students usually only go to school for about four hours every day , but after that , they spend <MASK> in school every day .",
          " no , most children in America only go to school Monday through Friday .",
          " In most schools , they study about nine subjects .",
          " some private schools require their students to wear uniforms , but public schools don't .",
          " I went to a private school for elementary school and university , but went to a public school for high school . What about you ?",
          " did you have to wear uniforms ?",
          " at least you didn't waste time thinking about what you were going to wear every day !",
          " I'm ask for a pizza , please .",
          " You're right , that is great .",
          " Medium one will be perfect , thank you",
          " I like seafood on my pizza .",
          " Tuna sounds good today .",
          " That would be to go .",
          " No problem .",
          " Yes , I want to buy a VCR .",
          " No . I only want it to be a very good one . The best.It ' s a graduation gift for my son .",
          " Well , he uses our VCR at home.But he's going to university in the Fall , so he needs his own VCR .",
          " Yes , he sure does.In fact , he wants to become a movie producer himself.He wants to study film at the university .",
          " Please do .",
          " Yes , I know that . So I want him to have a good VCR to use .",
          " DVD ? Isn't that like a CD ?",
          " Why is a DVD better than a VCR ?",
          " But isn't it more expensive ?",
          " What's that ?",
          " And why not ?",
          " Hmm . Is that true ?",
          " Well . And what about DVDs ?",
          " Hmm . He might really appreciate that . I know he will start to collect movies at school . Especially if he studies film .",
          " Alright , please show me what you have .",
          " That's right .",
          " Yes , of course . Come in .",
          " I have lived here for twenty years .",
          " Yes , I have been here since <MASK> .",
          " Because I have just retired . I want to buy a small house in the country .",
          " 6850 pound .",
          " It's worth every penny of it .",
          " Women always have the last word .",
          " I have a question .",
          " I need to take the driver's course . How many hours do I need ?",
          " I need to get my license .",
          " How many hours a day can I do ?",
          " That's all I need to do to finish ?",
          " Thanks . I'll get back to you .",
          " Well , I'm leaving Japan and I'm going back to London , tomorrow .",
          " Yeah .",
          " Well , I do feel quite down because I am going to miss Japan after being here for <MASK> , in Japan . I am going to miss it so much , cause I've had a great time here .",
          " Oh , I am going to miss the people , the food , the night life . Especially the nightlife .",
          " Well , I really like dancing . And I enjoy going out to night clubs and to restaurants and eating Japanese food also and I'm really going to miss that because it's very different to London .",
          " Well , here there are many different clubs you can get into , for free , you don't have to pay , some of them . In London it's really expensive for drinks and an entry fee .",
          " Hello , Hong Lei . My name's Ricky .",
          " Yes , I had my first lesson this morning . Are you a new student too ?",
          " Six months . That's a long time .",
          " Intermediate Three . And what about you ?",
          " I can't remember her name , but she's got curly red hair .",
          " Yes , I think so .",
          " Yes that's right . Do you know her ? Is she your teacher too ?",
          " Only a week .",
          " Well , I'm staying at the YMCA at the moment . I'm looking for somewhere more permanent . Do you know of any good places ?",
          " That would be great ! Thanks for your help . Can I buy you coffee ?",
          " May I ask you something ?",
          " How many hours behind the wheel do I need ?",
          " I'm trying to get my license .",
          " Can I do all six hours in one day ?",
          " That's all I have to do ?",
          " Well , that's a relief .",
          " I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ' s better to get to know it . What about you ?",
          " Oh , my God ! John , I didn ' t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory .",
          " But I ' m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?",
          " I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ' t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ?",
          " Really ?",
          " Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?",
          " How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?",
          " So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?",
          " Why did they want to found a college ?",
          " Oh , I see .",
          " When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?",
          " It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .",
          " Wow , I didn ' t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history .",
          " I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .",
          " That ' s right . I have a lot to learn from you .",
          " Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad .",
          " Are you Chinese ?",
          " How do you like it ?",
          " I want to study Mandarin and international relations .",
          " They teach regular characters .",
          " You just said your English needs work , yes ?",
          " Well , I am very serious about learning Chinese.But for me the hard part now is pronunciation.You have the four tones in Chinese . It is very hard . Maybe , if you have time , maybe we could do a language exchange .",
          " Yes , why not ? I mean , if you come to this cafe often , maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English .",
          " Let's see ... My schedule right now is quite busy.But I think I could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange .",
          " First , we could spend 45 minutes working on your English writing.If you want , I could help you edit your papers.Or we could do English conversation . Whatever you want.And then the next <MASK> you would help me with my Chinese .",
          " No . For me right now , the important thing is spoken Chinese . I need practice . So you could tutor me in speaking.We could use my textbook , and you could ask me questions.Then you could correct my mistakes .",
          " Well , today is Monday.Actually , for me Monday at this time would be the best . I am free from now until 11",
          " So if you want to meet at 10",
          " And I will bring my textbook and a tape recorder . I would like to record some things so I can practice on my own .",
          " Sure . I'll give you mine too . Then we can call if we have to cancel for some reason .",
          " The notice you received is a 30 - day notice to vacate .",
          " I mentioned to you before that you need to keep up with your rent . This notice to evict is letting you know that I mean business .",
          " You have <MASK> to catch up on your rent , or a sheriff will evict you .",
          " You can stay , but you might think about looking for a less expensive living arrangement if you are having trouble making the payments .",
          " Thank you . The payment needs to be in the form of cash or a cashier ' s check .",
          " Yes . I gotta review all of them for the final exam . It is just around the corner .",
          " That depends . Some semesters have many , some don't . And some courses don't have exams but only ask for papers . That's easy .",
          " Honestly speaking , most students prepare it one month before the exam .",
          " Of course , it's useful . And it's very crucial to have the copies of teacher's notes , because most questions in the exam are based on them .",
          " But the exam is not as simple as you may imagine . We have to stay up late .",
          " Yes , some people even pack up his bed quilt and sleep there . That's a little bit crazy .",
          " Sure , would you prefer looking in the morning or afternoon ?",
          " Can you go during the week , or can you only go during the weekend ?",
          " Where would you like me to pick you up ?",
          " I am thinking of looking at three houses , and it will take <MASK> .",
          " Once I contact the owners and confirm the times , I will e-mail you a schedule .",
          " Do you know how many you need ?",
          " We can get started as soon as you fill out this form .",
          " You won't be able to tell the difference with a magnifying glass .",
          " Very good . You can pick up your order in one week .",
          " We can do that , but you'll have to pay a little extra .",
          " Oh , I am so tired . My back is sore and my neck hurts .",
          " You are wrong , Shirley . I was always absent-minded in the class . I meant to concentrate on the class , but I was just so tired . Maybe I am old .",
          " One of my friends took the Adult College Entrance Exam last year . He filled the school column with his name , and his score was relinquished .",
          " He said he hadn't taken any exams for <MASK> , and couldn't get used to it immediately . He was extremely nervous then .",
          " Yeah . The test was fairly easy and almost every test-taker could pass that exam . Adult College Entrance Exam is much easier than college entrance exam . And there are fewer subjects .",
          " Excellent . How many would you like ?",
          " You need to fill out this form , please .",
          " That will be no problem , sir .",
          " Very good , sir . Your order will be ready in one week .",
          " No problem , sir . But it will cost you extra .",
          " Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate .",
          " He asked me how long it took me to learn English .",
          " Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes .",
          " You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice .",
          " I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it .",
          " Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English .",
          " He said , <MASK> , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good .",
          " much better than it did yesterday .",
          " I not only passed my test , but I aced it ! I'm so happy !",
          " thanks for helping me with it . If you hadn't encouraged me to do my best , I wouldn't have ever been able to pass .",
          " did you always do well at school ?",
          " really ?",
          " I'll get my finals in <MASK> .",
          " most students just cram the night forehead .",
          " no , I think I should study a little bit at a time , starting a few weeks before the exam .",
          " I'll go and talk to my professor or a learning support assistant .",
          " Sure . What's the matter with you ?",
          " Don't be so nervous ! Relax ! First , sleep early at night . Second , study <MASK> a day after school . Third , don't tire yourself out , but don't be lazy . Will that help ?",
          " part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ?",
          " sure , I have a part-time job as a bartender .",
          " yeah , but I ' m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset .",
          " of course . There ' s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world .",
          " not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life .",
          " sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks , it ' s easy to figure out .",
          " maybe you can come to the bar <MASK> and I ' ll show you around .",
          " I want to enrich my knowledge in management . The United States is an ideal place for me .",
          " Before I work in the office , I was a teacher . So if possible , I'd like to come back to some school to pass on my new knowledge to more people .",
          " Yes . You know , English is my present working language . Besides , I scored very high in TOEFL .",
          " I will support myself . In recent years , I have saved enough money for my study in the U . S .",
          " I will be there for <MASK> .",
          " Fine , thanks . How are you ?",
          " Oh my lord . I haven't really started them .",
          " I know but I was busy with my part-time job the last few days .",
          " To be honest with you , Jason , I don't think I'm doing a very good job of balancing my schoolwork with my job . I'm always two steps behind . I've got to get back to the dorm and continue writing that paper . Say ! Why don ' t you talk to your advisor ? And let me know !",
          " What ?",
          " Wow ! Congratulation ! When do classes start ?",
          " You ' re so lucky ! Do you have to do many things before you leave ?",
          " When can you do that ?",
          " Sure . What can you choose from ?",
          " What is your major ?",
          " What are the fundamental course ?",
          " Interesting . That ' s very different from the Chinese education system .",
          " Really ?",
          " why not ?",
          " What ? You ' re tired ? But we just started about twenty minutes ago .",
          " What ' s the matter ? Didn ' t you sleep well last night ?",
          " Then when did you go to sleep ?",
          " When ?",
          " Oh , Susie . Didn ' t I tell you over and over again that you wouldn ' t be able to climb the mountain unless you got enough sleep ?",
          " This is a <MASK> trip . We ' ll have to keep going and try to reach the top by noon or give up right now and go home . Which one do you choose ?",
          " So , make up your mind quickly . Whether to keep going or give up .",
          " Yes . May I help you ?",
          " I'd be very glad to show you around , but I'm very busy right now . Could you come back about 3 thirty ?",
          " Good . See you later .",
          " It can't be that bad .",
          " At least the subway is better than the bus . It's faster for one thing . And usually less crowded . But the drawback is that the subway is more expensive than the bus . It adds up over time , if you take it every day .",
          " I ride my bike . I don't live too far away , so it's pretty convenient . it's only about a <MASK> bike ride from my house to the office .",
          " Yes , not only a good way to keep in shape , but a good way to relieve stress as well . While you're stressed out by your commute , I'm releasing all the stress of the day with mine .",
          " I know ! I hate it ! But I ' m taking this crash course in math .",
          " I have to take my exams for getting into the university , so I need to prepare .",
          " It has to ! I ' Ve been studying every day , <MASK> a day ! I don ' t know , but the school has a great success record .",
          " I ' ll pick up an application form for you at school tomorrow .",
          " Today is so hot , besides I had so much housework to do . My friend came for a visit and stayed for <MASK> . I didn ' t forget , but I had no time at all .",
          " Yes . I ' m sorry .",
          " Yes , I ' m sorry . I know it bothers you very much . But I don ' t know why Chinese sometimes would do this .",
          " But you know if he brought it or not , right ?",
          " I'd like to introduce myself first .",
          " My name is Gavin White . I was born and raised in London . After high school , I went to Edinburgh University . I worked for <MASK> to pay for my tuition and then got my Bachelor ' s degree there . Now I've come here to get my Master ' s degree . I am glad to meet all of you and I hope we will become good friends .",
          " My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s . Easier said then done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date .",
          " I will find one myself , of course . I ' m a modern girl .",
          " You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea .",
          " I don ' t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time .",
          " Anyway , I don ' t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that .",
          " I don ' t want to post my personal information on the internet . I ' m not knowing who is reading it .",
          " I am , sir .",
          " It's me , sir . But I am sorry I have forgotten to prepare for it .",
          " I don ' t know ! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . Luckily , I managed to start it up and drive it here . What do you think it is ?",
          " What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ' s brand new !",
          " Ugh ... So how long is this going to take ? An hour ?",
          " What ! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping ? This is not happening !",
          " To be honest , Ava , I've just had a really bad day .",
          " First , I slept through my alarm and ended up <MASK> late to work .",
          " He told me that if I showed up late one more time , he'd fire me . He's so mean !",
          " That was my second time . The first time , I was in a car accident .",
          " No , he's from Australia . Before I met him , I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going . I had no idea he'd be so fussy about things .",
          " I think I'm going to look for another job . I need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss .",
          " That's very generous of you . Thanks for the offer .",
          " Uh well ... would you like the bad news first or the really bad news ?",
          " Well sir , our sales have dropped , no plunged , fifty percent in the past month alone . We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ' s a real mess .",
          " Um ... how can I put this ? Let ' s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for Chapter eleven in <MASK> .",
          " Oh , that ' s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ' re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ' re going to have to shoulder this cost .",
          " We tried that , sir . The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country .",
          " There is some really good news though !",
          " I got offered a new job !",
          " To study . I am going to the University of Tampa to do a postgraduate course for three years .",
          " Yes , here it is .",
          " I've got a letter from my bank here . It shows I am able to support myself during these three years of studies .",
          " Yes , here it is .",
          " Oh , but mine is a three-year program .",
          " Okay , thank you .",
          " Oh , no ! No more paddling ! My arms are sore !",
          " Beth , what date is today ?",
          " What is the date today ?",
          " Oh , i almost forgot . Today is my mom's birthday .",
          " Thanks ! I will do that ! When is your birthday ?",
          " Wow ! What a lucky girl ! Your birthday is on Christmas Day .",
          " April 2nd . I missed being a target of a lot of jokes by <MASK> . I guess I am lucky , too !",
          " Thanks .",
          " I guess so .",
          " That should work out great . You are miracle worker ! You have got me awake and motivated .",
          " No . Only for a couple of weeks .",
          " I am going to register at Harvard next month .",
          " I am going to major in tourism . What about you ? How long have you been here ?",
          " Well . You should be able to give me some advice on where to stay . At the moment , I am staying in a hotel which is far away from the school .",
          " It ' s a skill . What can I say ? I don ' t know why , I just have a long routine .",
          " Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ' t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ' s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ' ll put my hair up , butoften times I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ' s another <MASK> or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine .",
          " Not funny .",
          " Five days a week , too ?",
          " Gosh !",
          " Where are you going now ?",
          " When do you start school ?",
          " That's good .",
          " I ' m going to visit my brother . he ' s just had a baby . He lives in Minneapolis .",
          " I ' ll be here for approximately three weeks . See , here ' s my return ticket for the twenty-sixth of March .",
          " My brother , here , this is an invitation letter from him . I will stay with him and his family in their home .",
          " Well , I own a house . actually , I ' m leaving my dog there with my neighbors . I have a car at home , and oh , my job ! I ' m employed by Tornal as an engineer . Actually , I only have <MASK> ' vacation , so I have to go back to work at the end of March .",
          " Well , I do have assets in my country . like I said , I own a house , and see , here ' s a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance .",
          " No problem , what class would you like to take ?",
          " There are two classes that are still open .",
          " The first class is a Tuesday and Thursday class from two to three .",
          " The other class is on Monday and Wednesday from <MASK> - 12 .",
          " I'm positive .",
          " Okay , I'll sign you up .",
          " What class are you trying to take ?",
          " Well , there are only two classes open .",
          " One class is on Tuesday and Thursday from 2 p . m . to 4 .",
          " That class is from <MASK> and Wednesday .",
          " Yes , I am sure .",
          " Very well then .",
          " Yes . I am very interested in the Olympic Games , and I'm especially excited about 2008 Beijing Olympics .",
          " That's cool . Care for a little quiz on that ?",
          " Wow , you've talked the talk . Now it's time to walk the walk . Here we go . First , can you tell me something about the ancient Olympics ?",
          " Good . Why do people name it Olympics ?",
          " Who started the modern Olympics ?",
          " What did people call him ?",
          " What did he do for restoring the Olympics ?",
          " Well , that's for all . Excellent !",
          " Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city ?",
          " Fantastic ! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds !",
          " Quite a lot . The celebration of the New Year has just started . The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast , and people in the North have Jiaozi . Afterward , we will make New Year calls on family relatives , husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second .",
          " That's for sure . Fruit , cream cakes , medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives , and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids . All this , of course , should be well prepared beforehand .",
          " Not all the same nowadays I must say . Many families , especially those of newly married couples , choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines . Rose and I had a tour to Singapore , Malaysia , Thailand and Hong Kong last year . We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday .",
          " Well , for city dwellers , the Spring Festival is a holiday of seven days . While in the country where traditions are still heavily emphasized , the festival lasts <MASK> .",
          " Our science field trip is next Monday at 8 a . m . in the morning . Can you mark that on your calendar ?",
          " That will be Monday , December 2nd . We need to start loading the buses half an hour early , so plan to arrive at 7 .",
          " We will return 6 days later on December 8th . Will someone be picking you up ?",
          " The return bus will leave the campground at 5 p . m . and return to campus <MASK> at 8 p . m .",
          " I am going to post all of that information on the geology club web page . Check it out when you get a chance . See you Monday !",
          " I need to return a book .",
          " I want to check these books out .",
          " That ' s all .",
          " It ' s right here .",
          " Yes . That ' s it .",
          " All right . Have a good night .",
          " My girlfriend just broke up with me .",
          " Yeah .",
          " You've been through this too ?",
          " But it hurts too much .",
          " What if I don't want to find another girl ?",
          " You're right .",
          " Yeah . Thanks for the talk .",
          " Ok . I'll talk to you later .",
          " Didn't I tell you ? It's over !",
          " It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our <MASK> anniversary , but she stood me up !",
          " No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home !",
          " I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that the night , but she didn't answer the phone .",
          " I know . I still haven't heard from her . The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around .",
          " I guess so .",
          " I could meet with you tomorrow anywhere from two until four ; what time works out best ?",
          " I am glad that that works out ; can you find my office ?",
          " Just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the third floor .",
          " If you do get lost , just ask someone in the building to point the way .",
          " If you need to cancel your appointment , please give me a call !",
          " Hi Steve . This is Mike . What are you doing ?",
          " There's nothing to watch right now .",
          " Me too . Let's get together and do something .",
          " Yeah . Let's plan something tomorrow .",
          " I think it is going to be the same as today . Clear and sunny .",
          " Are there any special events going on tomorrow ?",
          " Oh yeah . I heard about that too . Let's go check it out .",
          " It starts at <MASK> .",
          " Perfect . I'll see you in front of the apartment at eleven thirty .",
          " Yes . Have you ever been in one of his classes ?",
          " He was a very easy teacher . Are you thinking of taking a class with him ?",
          " Grades are important , but don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important , too ?",
          " He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by . Do you know what I mean ?",
          " Did you know that he came here last year after <MASK> in the military ?",
          " I think you know that you have to make the best decision for you . Enjoy your year !",
          " Hey , Anna , this is Jason .",
          " Yes . How are you , Anna ?",
          " Working . I've been really busy these days . I got a promotion .",
          " Thanks . I am feeling pretty good about myself too . You know , bigger office , a raise and even an assistant .",
          " You are kidding .",
          " A bit over two years . This is a fast-moving company , and seniority isn ' t the only factor in deciding promotions .",
          " She is very nice and open-minded .",
          " Yeah . He was a real slave driver . He probably would have loved it if we were robots .",
          " Good . <MASK> .",
          " Bye .",
          " I ' m returning these books .",
          " Here are all of them .",
          " I didn ' t have time to return them .",
          " How much ?",
          " 25 cents a day ?",
          " That ' s expensive .",
          " Certainly , where will you be coming from ?",
          " Ok . Take the Underground ( the Circle line ) to High Street Kensington . Make sure you take the High Street Kensington exit .",
          " Ok - when you leave the Underground , cross the road and you should see Horntown Street . Was up that street to the crossroads . As you was you should see a fast food place on your right .",
          " No , you need to turn left into Philimore Was and take the next right .",
          " That's fine . You will not miss it because it's just next to the Kensington centra Library .",
          " Ok , we live in the third building on your left . Will we see you around <MASK> ?",
          " Yes , why ?",
          " So ?",
          " That sounds great . But how do you know that's a crush or a real love ?",
          " That's a big question . Well , if you're in love , maybe you will take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all .",
          " And you think about her all the time ?",
          " And maybe you suddenly have new interests . I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid . For instance , you used to sleep in every morning , but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging .",
          " Oh , congratulations . Sounds like you've found your soul mate .",
          " Yes , that's right . If you find this person becomes more and more important to you and you can totally trust her , then you can stay in love .",
          " Can you tell me something about the Spring Festival ?",
          " Christmas is also a special time for us to have the family reunion and to express our best wishes to those we love and those who love us in the coming new year .",
          " What are the children doing ?",
          " I heard one of the purposes to do it is to frighten the devils so they will not come to do any harm to people in the next year .",
          " Who will get the money ?",
          " What time will the library be closing ?",
          " Does it always close at six ?",
          " Will the library be open on Saturday ?",
          " What are your hours on Saturday ?",
          " All right . Thank you .",
          " That ' s it . Thank you .",
          " fine , thanks . How are you ?",
          " oh , my lord . I haven't really started them .",
          " I know but I was busy with my part-time job the last few days .",
          " to be honest with you , Jason , I don't think I'm doing a very good job of balancing my schoolwork with my job . I'm always two steps behind . I've got to get back to the dorm and continue writing tha",
          " Hackneyed theme !",
          " Nearly everything .",
          " Too easy questions . Listen carefully . Hollywood is the movie capital of the world.It is located in southern California . Many films have been made there , and the kinds have changed often .",
          " Gangster movies . Movie-goers at that time could get a look at the people involved in crime and their violent activities by watching it .",
          " After all that violence , people needed to laugh , so from the mid-to-late l940 ' s , many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made . Then came musicals .",
          " Right . By the mid - 50 ' s , this light-hearted genre was competing with films about more serious subjects . There was one kind that could be found throughout all of these years , and that was the , mm , the . . .",
          " Come on .",
          " Any more ?",
          " What's the problem ?",
          " Is there a problem ?",
          " I apologize for their tardiness .",
          " Again , I do apologize for the inconvenience .",
          " Seeing as they were late , that won't be a problem .",
          " I'm going to refund your money right now .",
          " I wish it could be Germany . But it seems they are not in a very good conditions .",
          " It seems they've been out of luck since the beginning of the event . Their shots hit the woodwork as many as six times . Oh . my goodness ! I'm afraid the team is under a spell .",
          " I agree . Eeven though German attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders , they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate , well-timed passes .",
          " Yes . They have a good reputation for their tenacity and discipline , especially in vital , decisive encounters .",
          " Where have you been , Alice , you're over an hour late .",
          " why ere you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn ' t it ?",
          " Didn ' t you tell him you have an appointment ?",
          " Well . You ' re here .",
          " I don't know . Well , my contract here is for <MASK> , and I don't know what I should do after that . Maybe going around for a while .",
          " Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out .",
          " You hit the nail right on the head .",
          " What is it ?",
          " Awesome . I've been giving this a lot of thought . When can we do this ?",
          " Ok , cool .",
          " No problem .",
          " That ' s great . What are the prizes ?",
          " To encourage the staff increases .",
          " What about the afternoon ?",
          " Cool down , man . Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic . But life isn't really all that . You should take the initiative and make some changes first .",
          " I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . It may offer you many benefits . First , it's good for your health . I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate . While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . You might as well sleep out for a longer hour .",
          " Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great !",
          " I can hardly make ends meet these days .",
          " My income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .",
          " Definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .",
          " Yes , are you ?",
          " You do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you .",
          " Well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there !",
          " It does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .",
          " Ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here .",
          " I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night .",
          " I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?",
          " If I'm not back in <MASK> , come and find me .",
          " So what are you trying to say to me ?",
          " How should I say it ?",
          " It has only been <MASK> , our relationship hasn't had a chance to maturate . We are still have some hurdle we have to jump over .",
          " Last week I saw Brain kissing you on the cheek .",
          " That is ok , then ? Starts on the cheek ? pretty soon you french kiss in the back on his car .",
          " So is it ok if I kiss other women on the cheek ?",
          " You see , we still have hurdle .",
          " Which one will you be going to ?",
          " Sure , I've been meaning to visit that place myself .",
          " OK , can I bring a date with me ?",
          " Yes . that is a very good idea . It would be a shame if we could not find a place to sit .",
          " I'll be there . Oh , is there a cover charge at the bar ?",
          " I want to make sure I bring enough money for my date and I .",
          " One last question.Is there a dress code there ?",
          " Perfect . I wanted to have a casual evening tonight .",
          " Okay . See you then .",
          " It's as plain as the nose on your face . They're dating each other .",
          " Well , you can bet this relationship's going to be a flash in the pan .",
          " I think you are absolutely right . Actually , my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only <MASK> . They got married a month later .",
          " Well , I would say that I ' m just drifting - - here , in the pool .",
          " Well , it ' s very comfortable just to drift here .",
          " No .",
          " You got me .",
          " I said it's a lovely day . Why don't we go for a walk ?",
          " Come on ! A little labor , much health .",
          " Don't take too long . It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather .",
          " I Believe I will . Look for me near the lake .",
          " It's Monday , October 27 . Speaking of dates , when are you leaving ?",
          " Isn't it a Sunday ?",
          " So you are leaving <MASK> ?",
          " My husband and I have thought about it , but we ' Ve decided not to have any . They are just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of world we ' ll have in the future . What about you ?",
          " For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn ' t ever have to share .",
          " No way ! I spent <MASK> of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . you know , I don ' t think I ' Ve ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think of the one-child policy in China ?",
          " That ' s true . But as a woman , I ' m glad that even though I don ' t want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can ' t imagine what China would be like if there weren ' t a one-child policy !",
          " I don ' t know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children !",
          " My watch is a few minutes fast . It's about six forty , I think .",
          " If we start now , we can make it by taxi .",
          " Didn ' t I tell you ? It ' s over !",
          " It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our <MASK> anniversary , but she stood me up !",
          " No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her with another man at a club near my home !",
          " I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that night , but she didn't answer the phone .",
          " I know . I still haven ' t heard from her . The good thing is that I ' m so angry with her that I don ' t feel sad about not having her around .",
          " I guess so . It would be nice to know why she did this though .",
          " It's December eighteenth .",
          " Yes , I know that .",
          " Sure , a promise is a promise .",
          " What's the matter ?",
          " What teams are playing tonight ?",
          " That will be a tough match , right ?",
          " What are we waiting for ? It's already <MASK> now . Let's buy some drinks and desserts now .",
          " Don ' t worry . I don't think you ' re going to lose your job over one mistake .",
          " But it wasn ' t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do .",
          " Let ' s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ?",
          " Well , you can't have everything . Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job . When is your contract up on your apartment ?",
          " Well , that ' s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money .",
          " If you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ' ll save plenty of money .",
          " Hurry ! It is time for me to steal something .",
          " I am stealing vegetables at the Happy Farm .",
          " No , no . I mean stealing vegetables on Internet is very popular now . Many white collars join in this game and have a lot of fun by stealing others ' vegetables .",
          " You got what I meant . Perhaps , what I steal are not vegetables , but loneliness .",
          " It was wonderful , but I was so tired .",
          " Yes , that was the first thing we did . We went all the way to the top . There were visitorsfrom all over the world taking photos there .",
          " Art galleries , cathedrals , statues , fountains , palaces , bistros , there's really too much to say .",
          " Yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However , on the third day of travelling in the city , I felt sick I think I had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .",
          " On <MASK> , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic . And no stomach problems .",
          " You'll have to try for yourself some day .",
          " Not bad . We had a get-together with friends from college . I haven't seen many of them since graduation . How about you ?",
          " Sounds a good weekend . You know it always amazes me that two people as different as you and Jo can become such close friends .",
          " That's great . I know people who can't stand each other for even <MASK> .",
          " It seems you two bring out the best of one another .",
          " Yeah , you are so lucky to have found each other .",
          " Of course . I stay online for four hours at least every day .",
          " Millions of things . I surf the Net , check my e-mail , and most importantly , I chat with my friends .",
          " No , I am not . And I love to meet new people in the chat rooms who share a lot in common with me .",
          " Oh , hi Lucas , come on in . I'm Barbara . Nice to meet you .",
          " Would you like something to drink ? I've got tea and some grape juice .",
          " Oh , there is a supermarket not far from here . But there is also a tea house around the corner , where you can get tea , taste tea and get a tea set as well .",
          " You are right about that . It's quiet and very convenient . You can get to the bus and the subway stations within <MASK> ' walk . There's a grocery store , a book store , a gym , and many restaurants along the street .",
          " Well , if you want we can go together sometime . Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon , if you like , you can join me and I can show you the neighborhood along the way .",
          " Tomorrow ?",
          " That sounds great .",
          " OK . Dinner and a movie will be perfect .",
          " How <MASK> ?",
          " OK . Bye .",
          " Oh Jackie ? We broke up last week .",
          " It was actually a long <MASK> . She was a psycho .",
          " She would be laughing one moment , and if I said something insensitive , she would start crying . I didn't want to deal with that .",
          " She was a psycho , man . One time we were suppose to get together . I was waiting for her call , and when she finally called , she was screaming why I wasn't at her place .",
          " I thought she was going to call when she was done shopping . It was a misunderstanding . She was literally screaming on the phone over this .",
          " I'm just glad it's over .",
          " God ! Don't you think they should get you an assistant ?",
          " They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest .",
          " You'd better pay more attention to your health .",
          " You're welcome .",
          " Great . My family came to visit me .",
          " My immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me .",
          " I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ?",
          " Interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ?",
          " Do you get along well with each other ?",
          " You are very lucky to have such a nice family .",
          " Great ! I would like to see cute pandas , too .",
          " We can take the MET and get off at the Zoo Station .",
          " ( At the zoo ) Wow ! This zoo is really huge .",
          " Look at the map . It has different areas , such as marine lives , mammals , polar animals and insects .",
          " We have to go to the mammal area . We are at the gate right now . We need to go straight from here and turn left and go along to the end and make anotherleft turn .",
          " Everything's great . And you ?",
          " No , I haven't had a chance to . But I have been watching a Chinese TV scries called \" Chinese-Style Divorce \" .",
          " Yeah . I found it is so close to our life .",
          " You said it . You know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent year .",
          " I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married .",
          " That's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s ' generation .",
          " Definitely.They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously .",
          " I think , as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same with marriage .",
          " It's a little like being a mom , only I get paid for it !",
          " That's exactly why my business is doing so well !",
          " Well , I've been in business for <MASK> now and I have ten clients .",
          " If you ever need a job , let me know . I can always train you .",
          " Well , I've already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .",
          " I ' m planning on living with my parents . Won't you ?",
          " You mean they're kicking you out ?",
          " Well , it's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it's ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so .",
          " I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don't have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place .",
          " On <MASK> .",
          " People cook turkeys for Thanksgiving dinner .",
          " Besides the turkeys , we'll also have other delicious food . Such as pumpkin pies , puddings , mashed potatoes , bread , a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables .",
          " Nine total . Seven children and my parents .",
          " Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it .",
          " It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make .",
          " That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs .",
          " Same problem here . There's an <MASK> gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college .",
          " They do , but it doesn't help too much . Having seven children means that the money situation in my home is always pretty tight .",
          " I ' Ve been away on holidays for sometime .",
          " I went with my husband . Our first stop was Bangkok . We stayed there for 5 days . Then we flew to Hong Kong , stopover for 3 days . Our last stop was China . We visited the Great Wall .",
          " Yes . We enjoyed ourselves very much . Have you traveled much , Luke ?",
          " Oh , I see . Yeah . Some people like traveling , some don ' t . My husband didn ' t like traveling at first , either . He said what ' s the use of traveling ? A waste of money and a waste of time.At last I got him on the move . After all , he loved me . We went to Bali , Indonesia , one of the most beautiful places in the world . That trip left a very deep impression on him . Since then whenever we have holidays and money , we ' d like to patronize the travel agency . Isn ' t it a bit dull to shut yourself at one place all your life ?",
          " Yes , it is . May I help you ?",
          " What date , sir ?",
          " Let me see . Yes , we still have some tickets left . Which performance ?",
          " OK , we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan .",
          " All right . May I have you name , please ?",
          " When would you like to collect the tickets ?",
          " We can hold them until <MASK> before the show .",
          " Just telephone us , and let us know in advance . We don't charge for cancellation .",
          " You are welcome . Goodbye .",
          " Just watching some TV .",
          " Not really . Just watching the sports highlight on ESPN .",
          " Just killing time until I find something to do . What are you going to do ?",
          " You wanna shoot some hoops ?",
          " Where's your girlfriend ? I thought you were going out with her today .",
          " Let's go to Starbucks and think of something to do then .",
          " I only have a couple left . Why don't you pick some up on the way .",
          " Aright . See you there .",
          " I've been really stressed . It's the end of the year and I've got so much stuff to do ! I feel like I'm drowning in work .",
          " It's seriously affecting my life ! I can't sleep , I don't have much of an appetite and my husband says I've been kind of short tempered . Other people seem to handle stress okay ... why am I so weak ?",
          " Yeah , but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office . My stress is just about silly paperwork !",
          " So a deadline will cause that same reaction ?",
          " So the life of a cave woman was less stressful than my life ?",
          " Yes , Friday I have a class right after work .",
          " Saturday my parents are coming to town . What's up ?",
          " No . Did you want to go do something ?",
          " Oh ! That sounds great ! How <MASK> ?",
          " Hello sir . Good to meet you , too .",
          " Ok , Jason . So how was the flight ?",
          " Really ? But you were in first class ! Nobody woke that guy up ?",
          " That's terrible ! So you didn't get any sleep ?",
          " So , aside from visiting our factory and offices , are there any other things you want to accomplish while you're in China ?",
          " That's not a problem . We can have a company car take you there . It's only about a <MASK> drive .",
          " Pretty well , thanks . Still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit , but last night I got at lease <MASK> of rest .",
          " Yep . Let's do it . I'm pretty excited !",
          " Live chicken ? Thanks , but no thanks . So ... tell me about bargaining . How can I do it like a local ?",
          " Cool ! Teach me !",
          " Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs . The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items , you can figure out the relative prices of everything else .",
          " The Bible says that Jesus Christ was resurrected <MASK> after he was crucified . People commemorate that at a festival called Easter .",
          " We celebrate it on the first Sunday after a full moon on or after the 21st of March .",
          " We make a lot of Easter eggs and then paint some designs on them . We'll also go to church and pray .",
          " Just taking a smoke break .",
          " Sure . Here you go .",
          " I didn't know you smoked .",
          " Oh . You're new to smoking still . I've been smoking for <MASK> .",
          " Many times . I'm really addicted . It's harder to stop than you think .",
          " I highly recommend you quit soon . The longer you smoke , the harder it becomes to quit .",
          " No problem . I'll talk to you later .",
          " Hey , Daddy , today I had really a fantastic history class .",
          " We've learnt the story of Zheg He Sailing to West Ocean . He is a real great navigator .",
          " Yeah , he , with his fleet , came across the Indian Ocean , and arrived at the east coast of Africa .",
          " Of course , that is <MASK> , which is in Ming dynasty .",
          " Not yet , you know I have a lot of homework to do .",
          " OK , great Daddy , after supper , I'll embark on it .",
          " Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ?",
          " I won't tell you , unless you promise to let me watch it with you .",
          " Well , in the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulties in getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts .",
          " Now we have a <MASK> boy . We're very happy that he's healthy and smart .",
          " Right now he speaks mostly English , and he can say a few Chinese words . But he will learn in the future .",
          " Yes , people surely can . He's whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though .",
          " Hi , Shirley . I'm Sophie . It's nice to meet you .",
          " Please come in .",
          " I really appreciate it .",
          " I will . Actually , I am worried so much about the security of this community because my house has been burgled twice before .",
          " Really ? That's good . Is there any supermarket in our neighborhood ?",
          " That's terrific !",
          " Yeah , and we can get to know each other at the party .",
          " Yes , I nearly didn't sleep last night .",
          " No , I just watched Supergirl , and it began too late in the night . I was too excited to get asleep after one o'clock .",
          " The contestants are different . These girls perform in free styles .",
          " I think <MASK> . This year I didn't watch any entertainment programs . Too many ads between the programs . I prefer listening to the radio .",
          " If they could make beautiful ads , I could bear .",
          " Don't mention it . It's my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ?",
          " I'll bet you were a little embarrassed .",
          " Cookouts often start slowly . A <MASK> start means you arrive any time after two .",
          " I was late getting back from the mall , but I'm hurrying .",
          " Don't worry . We won't be the first .",
          " Yes , fine . I had something wrong with my stomach . I won ' t go into detail , but it wasn ' t serious .",
          " I think most people are a little nervous about it . I was really very , very nervous just before I had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation .",
          " Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ' t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing .",
          " I certainly was ! However , the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn ' t eat for <MASK> , and steak was on the list !",
          " No , not at all . I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days .",
          " Oh , yes . The nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what I could drink . In the end , I just drank water and nothing else . Everyone was very professional and I actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay .",
          " I use it almost every day , but I usually only use it to check my email . I don ' t often surf the net . You use the internet a lot , don ' t you ?",
          " So , you ' re online <MASK> a day .",
          " How useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?",
          " How do you solve the website problems when you ' re buying something online ?",
          " Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ' t you ?",
          " I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ' t pay much attention in art class at school .",
          " I like sculpture , especially that from ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ' d love to go with you .",
          " That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ?",
          " Yes , it's so cold .",
          " Yes , I think so . The rainy season will be over soon .",
          " <MASK> .",
          " I'm used to this kind of days .",
          " Spring will come soon . And we will have some pleasant weather then .",
          " Today is Thursday .",
          " Today is <MASK> .",
          " Well , I don't think so .",
          " I ' m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey , where many historical figures are buried , like Isaac Newton , the great mathematician and Winston Churchill , the great wartime leader .",
          " Women have often played an important role in British history . Queen Elizabeth I built a navy strong enough to fight off the Spanish armada in 1588 . more recently , Margaret thatcher transformed british society in the <MASK> ' s .",
          " There ' s a lot to see there . Perhaps we should go tomorrow .",
          " I ' Ve seen them before . They ' re quite incredible . If you want to see historical figures in London , there ' s one place you have to go .",
          " There you can see british leaders , entertainers , criminals , and royalty .",
          " I ' m not sure , but probably <MASK> . How about in your country ?",
          " I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .",
          " Did she ? That ' s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .",
          " Oh , he ' s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays .",
          " I had mine when I was 24 . that ' s a little young . I ' d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .",
          " Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ?",
          " Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom .",
          " That is awesome . Congratulations ! I know you can make it .",
          " Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . Say <MASK> , ok ?",
          " See you !",
          " My friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name by the item they will buy .",
          " Most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ' s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home .",
          " I bought a sewing machine . I know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems .",
          " She says that after several years of use , it ' s not working properly . When she uses it , it makes a funny noise .",
          " I think it ' s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . Because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances don ' t need to last more than five or <MASK> at most .",
          " I see . Well , can I have a look at your phone ? Unfortunately , this phone can ' t be used in the US , it ' s not compatible with our 3G network .",
          " Well , you ' re in luck ! You see , if you sign up for our three-year plan , we ' ll throw in a handset for free .",
          " There ' s no catch ! You just choose a plan , sign a <MASK> contract and , that ' s it ! Actually , we ' re running a special promotion right now , and we ' re giving away a Blackberry Curve with our special Mega Value forty dollar plan .",
          " Well , you get nine hundred anytime minutes , and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other Tel-Mobile clients , one thousand text messages per month , and unlimited evening and weekend minutes . Oh , and we also offer a rollover option .",
          " That ' s right , plus the activation fee , the emergency services fee , the monthly service fee , oh , and any charges for extra minutes , and ...",
          " Yes . Work starts at eight and I arrive home after six .",
          " I can take a break at lunch time , but it is only <MASK> .",
          " Yes , I really don't like it .",
          " What's the matter ?",
          " How could you cheat on your wife ? You have been married for ten years .",
          " I will try my best to persuade her to reconsider the divorce . But are you sure that from now on you will be faithful to her forever ?",
          " Yes ! Yes ! And yes ! Jared , of course I ' ll marry you !",
          " Oh , Jared ! I can ' t wait for our wedding ! I hope you don ' t mind , but I ' Ve already chosen a date ! Six months from now in the summer ! Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I ' Ve had plenty of time to start planning !",
          " Oh don ' t worry , sweetie , I didn ' t know when you were going to propose . It was still a nice surprise ! As I was saying , I ' Ve got it all planned out . There ' s almost nothing left to do ! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending .",
          " No need to sweat it . My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding , which is going to be low-budget anyway . So roughly four hundred people , which means that the hall at Northwoods Heights will be our reception venue . I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents ' church and my uncle of course would be officiating . We ' ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling . The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer . My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that . My cousin will be the official photographer . I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . Did you know that she ' s going to be a professional opera singer ?",
          " And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ' ll get the Youth Group to serve us . I was thinking that your friend ' s band could be our entertainment for the night . though they might have to tone it down a bit . Or we could hire a DJ . Your sister ' s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ' s their name again ? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine . And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ' ll make our toasts ! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? Who else am I missing ? Oh , your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake !",
          " See ? It ' s going to be wonderful ! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of .",
          " Yeah , I just got back this morning .",
          " Well , we were only there for <MASK> , so we didn't do too much . We went shopping and went out to dinner a few times . And at night we walked around the city with some friends .",
          " Yes , I have them with me . Do you want to look at them ?",
          " This one is of my wife and me on the beach , and this one is our daughter Emily standing next to my wife .",
          " I know , they look very similar .",
          " That was taken at the train station before we left .",
          " No , not this time . We went there last time .",
          " Yeah , it was a lot of fun .",
          " There're many things I can do on weekends .",
          " I'm keen on talking short trips to nearby scenic spots . More often than not , I go with some of my friends . By the way , what are your favorites ?",
          " That's great ! I think they do you a lot of good . Where do you swim ?",
          " I'm fond of dancing .",
          " Fine , I'll take a taxi .",
          " Never thought about it , I sure you are right . It's quite a short walk .",
          " Are you trying to lose weight ?",
          " You don ' t have to starve yourself to lose weight . I think that ' s where you ' re going wrong .",
          " Not really . You should try to not eat foods high in calories , salts or saturated fats . Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors .",
          " Yes ! You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol . You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish .",
          " Don ' t count on it .",
          " But where have you been , Alice ? You're over an hour late .",
          " But why were you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn't it ?",
          " But didn't you tell him you had an appointment ?",
          " Well , you're here . And that's the main thing .",
          " Cinct de mayo ?",
          " Do we get a day off from school then ?",
          " Www , man !",
          " Cool ! Is that why we only work <MASK> now ?",
          " And then what happened ?",
          " Just a minute . It's ten to nine by my watch .",
          " What's the hurry ?",
          " You've plenty of time yet . The railway station is very close . It won't take <MASK> to get there .",
          " That ' s the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter , I think .",

          " Ok . My next problem is to convert 10000 british pounds into us dollars . What ' s the exchange rate at the moment ?",
          " That means that 10.000 pounds will buy me 18.500 dollars .",
          " Fractions . What ' s a quarter and an eighth ? That ' s three-eights . Easy . The next question is \u201c what are prime numbers ? \u201d .",
          " So , 1,2 and 3 are prime numbers , but 4 isn ' t because 2 * 2 = 4 .",
          " How many seconds in an hour ? 60 seconds multiplied by 60 minutes equals 3600 seconds altogether .",
          " Yeah . I saw a science program . It was quite interesting .",
          " Mars . Scientists say there might be water on it .",
          " I hope so . Did you know the US successfully sent two robotic explorers to Mars last month ?",
          " Yes . Both have sent back pictures of the planet . And the latter did a better job .",
          " Summers are hot and usually lasts a long time . Winters are short , but cold , wet , and windy . I love the summers in my city , but I hate the wintertime .",
          " We usually get a big thunderstorm <MASK> , but apart from that , summers are dry . Thunderstorms make the air fresh again , so most people don ' t mind then .",
          " I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again . In spring , the weather is very changeable-sometimes cold , sometimes warm . It ' s usually windy with some rain . Autumn is usually sunny and dry , but it ' s gradually gets colder as winter arrives . What are the seasons like in you city ?",
          " Do you usually go on a summer holiday ?",
          " I usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn . I try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city .",
          " Sure , what time ?",
          " For how many people ?",
          " Western food or Chinese food ?",
          " Do you want an expensive meal ?",
          " How much would you like to spend for each person ?",
          " Forty to eighty RIB Yuan a plate .",
          " OK . Is there anything special you'd like to have on the menu ?",
          " Anything you'd rather not have ?",
          " How about drinks ?",
          " Well . Dinner for ten at sixty Yuan a plate , drink's extra , at <MASK> . Is that all right ?",
          " My pleasure , see you tomorrow evening .",
          " Well , I nearly always get up at dawn . I don ' t like sleeping in late . The days are longer in summer than in winter , so I get up in summer . I usually do some exercise when I get up .",
          " I usually have cereal , but sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast .",
          " I usually do housework in mornings . I go shopping occasionally . I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket . I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center . It takes <MASK> to drive there .",
          " I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies . I spend winter evening watching tv , but I spend summer evening at cultural events if I have time .",
          " What time do you open this evening ?",
          " I see . I'd like to reserve a table for two .",
          " I'm not sure , perhaps around 8 pm .",
          " Davis .",
          " Oh , any chance of a table by the window ? My wife loves the bird's eye view . As it's her birthday , I want it to be a celebration .",

          " Thank you .",
          " Don't worry . He'll cross that bridge when he comes to it . My son reads a lot on his computer and uses e-mail to send messages to his friends almost every day . He's really absorbed by the discussions .",
          " I guess using a computer has a great deal to do with human interaction . Getting in touch with each other must be more fun to your wife and my son than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .",
          " Oh , Goodness , please not again.That ' s what we did last week .",
          " Right , it was a chick flick , just like this one , so what's the difference ? Besides , this is the last week for the third movie in Destroyer series and I want to see that on a big screen . Action movies need to be seen in a theater on a big screen .",
          " Oh , sure , it was great . I had popcorn for dinner and paid the price of a movie ticket to get a <MASK> nap .",
          " That place doesn't have a single meat dish.Just fish and shellfish and you know I don't like fish that much .",
          " But when I pick the restaurant , we go to a place that has both chicken and fish . I always respect your food preferences .",
          " Now you're talking , we can see that love story next time .",
          " He's late again . Traffic is probably holding him up . You know , he commutes from the suburbs . It's not easy commuting every day . We should cut him some slack .",
          " Oh , that's right . Well , the train shouldn't be late . That means there is only one explanation ... Bill must have overslept .",
          " That's right , because he's got to get to the train station from his house , then take the blue line into the city , then switch trains to the red line . In all , the trip's got to take <MASK> .",
          " It's too difficult to park your car in the city . Also , the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare .",
          " I love swimming and cycling . On Saturday morning I usually ride my bike around the city or the country road for almost <MASK> .",
          " Sure , they do .",
          " Because it is convenient and good for environmental protection .",
          " That ' s what I can do .",
          " Nine total . Seven children and my parents .",
          " Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it .",
          " It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make .",
          " That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs .",
          " Same problem here . There's an <MASK> gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college .",
          " I just found out that my husband is cheating on me .",
          " That's what I thought . It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months .",
          " I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark . She then asked if I was his sister , and I said no , I was his wife . She hung up immediately .",
          " Yeah , he first said it was someone from work . He gave me a lame excuse , and so I pressed him on it .",
          " He kept trying to make stupid excuses , and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion .",
          " I told him I would divorce him if he wouldn ' t tell me the truth or end the relationship with her .",
          " Well , I ' Ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .",
          " I ' m planning on living with my parents . Won ' t you ?",
          " You mean they ' re kicking you out ?",
          " Well , it ' s not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it ' s ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so .",
          " I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don ' t have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place .",
          " Lily broke up with me last week . In fact , she dumped me .",
          " She said it was because we had very different ideas about life .",
          " Of course not . I knew she had fallen in love with another guy . It is difficult to see her move on so quickly .",
          " Thank you , Steven . You are really a good friend .",
          " I wish I could , but I'm busy . I'm going to work at a soup kitchen tonight .",
          " Nah , it's a place where homelesspeople go to eat .",
          " Well , the minister at my church told us about it , and it seemed interesting . I thought I'd try it once , and if I didn't like it I'd stop .",
          " It's simple . All we do is prepare some food , usually sandwiches and some fruit , and give it out to them at the soup kitchen .",
          " Only <MASK> , for a couple of days a month . Why don't you give it a try ?",
          " Come on , it's easy , and it'll make you feel good . Why don't you come with me tonight ?",
          " OK . When ?",
          " <MASK> ?",
          " Sorry , that's too late . I usually go to bed around 10:00 PM .",
          " No , that's too early . I'll still be at work then .",
          " That's fine .",
          " Alright . Bye .",
          " Hi , Don . What a surprise !",
          " Have you noticed what has changed ?",
          " Yes . I ' m on a diet , but I ' Ve not taken anything . I just eat less and exercise more . And it really worked in the past three months . I ' Ve lost twelve pounds .",
          " What kind of exercise do you think I do ? I just go to dance everyday after work . I ' m taking an amateur dance class . I dance <MASK> everyday .",
          " Sure . Join my class next week .",
          " Yes .",
          " I learned in college .",
          " Thank you .",
          " <MASK> .",
          " Yes , she just got here yesterday .",
          " No . I've never been there .",
          " Yes . I went there once on a business trip .",
          " I think the supermarket is closed now .",
          " It closes at 7:00 on Sundays .",
          " Don't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . It opens at 8: 00 .",
          " Let's take a walk for a half an hour . My sister will get here at about 8: 30PM and then we can all go out to dinner .",
          " She lives in San Francisco .",
          " I think she's lived there for <MASK> .",
          " San Diego .",
          " My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s.Easier set than done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date .",
          " I will find one myself , of course . I ' m a modern girl .",
          " You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea .",
          " I don ' t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time .",
          " Anyway , I don ' t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that .",
          " Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher .",
          " Not tonight . I promised to go to a concert with my sister .",
          " That sounds fine .",
          " I'll be there . You're still a fabulous cook , aren't you ?",
          " I'm ready . I'll look forward to it all Friday !",
          " No , not this weekend . I have too much work to do .",
          " My father lives in Washington DC .",
          " My mother died <MASK> .",
          " No , he's retired .",
          " Yes , two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here .",
          " Yes , I have two brothers who live in New York and a sister who lives in Boston .",
          " Not as much as I'd like to . Usually just on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas .",
          " Well , George . I guess I am . Why do you ask ?",
          " Yeah , definitely ! Thanks for inviting me .",
          " I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day , but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . How did you manage to get hold of them ?",
          " You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price .",
          " Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . I really appreciate that . So , what time are we going ?",
          " <MASK> , that's fine with me .",
          " So I'll see you tomorrow then at 8 .",
          " Ok , George . Bye !",
          " No . Does the newspaper say what has caused that ?",
          " I think the government should make a serves of moves to cool the market .",
          " Yes . Why ?",
          " So ?",
          " You are attracted to her . That sounds great , but how do you know that it is a crush or it's real love ?",
          " That's a big question . Well , if you are in love , maybe you ' ll take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all .",
          " And you think about her all the time ?",
          " And maybe you suddenly have new interests . I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid , ie.You used to sleep in every morning , but because she jogs every morning , then you begin to like jogging .",
          " Oh , congratulations ! Sounds like you ' Ve found your soul mate .",
          " Yeah , that's right . If you find this person is more and more important to you and you can totally trust her , then you can stay in love .",
          " While staying in love is even better .",
          " No I'm afraid not . I'm meeting Ruth then . How about the fourteenth in the morning ?",
          " What about the next day ?",
          " Yes , I think I am . Let's meet for lunch at mouth restaurant .",
          " That's fine . See you there !",
          " Nothing special .",
          " That's great . I would love to . And when ?",
          " No problem . However , maybe I should come early to help you prepare the dinner .",
          " All right , see you tonight .",
          " I like it . But how did you know about my new job ? I wanted to surprise you .",
          " Well , <MASK> I got a tip about a possible job opening at Ace Travel Agency over on Franklin Avenue .",
          " Well , anyway , I made a beeline over to their office , had an interview with the manager , and was told to start work the next day .",
          " Right now I ' m basically just a secretary , but if I ' m given the chance , I want to become a travel agent there .",
          " No , of course not . I ' Ve got a lot to learn yet . In the meantime , I just want to be a good secretary and not step on anyone ' s toes .",
          " Beg your pardon ?",
          " Oh , Let me see ... It's three forty-five . Er ... wait , My watch is <MASK> fast . So it should be three forty",
          " Today is Friday . Are you new in Beijing ?",
          " Welcome to Beijing . This is my business card . I'm an engineer . If you need any help in Beijing , just give me a call .",
          " Go ahead .",
          " It's October the 1st , our National Day . I'd like to talk some more , but I've got to get going now . It was nice talking to you , though .",
          " Yes , we're making plans for a tour .",
          " Well start out from Long Island this Friday . We've planned a <MASK> drive to Salt Lake City , where we'll join my brother and his family on his fortieth birthday .",
          " Oh , we'll spend the nights in hotels and enjoy local food as we pass by . How does it sound , David ?",
          " Yes , we'll take our time . And we'll go to Five-lake Strict and the Wall Street .",
          " You can say that again .",
          " Sure ! Are you okay ? You seem a bit worried.What ' s on your mind ?",
          " Okay ...",
          " What ? Why ? I mean , we ' Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ' re happy together , aren ' t we ?",
          " So , what are you saying ? You ' re breaking up with me because I ' m perfect ?",
          " Baby , come on . Don ' t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ' t leave me .",
          " Laura ...",
          " OK , please .",
          " I would recommend the mall , it's <MASK> , drive to the south in a taxi . It has a wide range of shops and restaurants .",
          " How old are your children ?",
          " I would recommend a day at the zoo . It's fun for all the family . There is also a water park just outside the city if you would like a day trip .",
          " I like current affairs programmes and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ?",
          " I agree . People often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence .",
          " right . You can ' t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programmes . They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programmes .",
          " that ' s great idea . But don ' t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?",
          " not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ' s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv , where you pay a fixed amount each mo",
          " well , there ' s a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes . Shall we ?",
          " On 20th May 1963 .",

          " It will begin at 5:30 .",
          " You can see it tomorrow .",
          " I ' m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey , where many historic figures are buried , like Isaac Newton , the great mathematician and Winston Churchill , the great wartime leader .",

          " There ' s a lot to see there . Perhaps we should go tomorrow .",
          " I ' Ve seen them before . They ' re quite incredible . If you want to see historical figures in London , there ' s one place you have to go .",
          " There you can see british leaders , entertainers , criminals , and royalty .",
          " It's hard to believe that we're really leaving . The past two weeks was like a dream .",
          " And the people were so friendly !",
          " Do you still remember the small restaurant at the corner of the street ?",
          " I ate so much that I wasn't hungry until afternoon the next day .",
          " Maybe we can come here again next summer .",
          " Hey , what's the time ?",
          " Don't worry . We can call a cab . It'll be alright .",
          " Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ' t you ?",
          " I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ' t pay much attention in art class at school .",
          " I like sculpture , especially that form ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ' d love to go with you .",
          " That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ?",
          " That's right",
          " Last night",
          " Yes , I enjoyed it very much .",
          " Let me see . Ah , yes , I've been to England , France , Germany , Italy and now I've been in Spain",
          " Two weeks",
          " That's right",
          " What's that ?",
          " Great ! Who's the bridegroom ?",
          " The guy always hands the girls in a line . When did he propose ?",
          " My gosh ! How romantic ! When's the big day ?",
          " Will it be a church wedding or a civil ceremony ?",
          " Who is the best man ?",
          " Nobody is OK , but you !",

          " I just opened my own restaurant . I'm also head chef .",
          " Well , I used to hate cooking , but now I love it .",
          " After I tried French food . Before that , I used to cook really boring things for my family .",
          " Yeah . I went to California to study .",
          " I was there between 88 and 90 .",
          " Then I came back here . I worked for <MASK> to get some experience .",
          " I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .",
          " I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ?",
          " Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?",
          " I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .",
          " We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .",
          " Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .",
          " Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible .",
          " I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .",
          " Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .",
          " Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for <MASK> . Then we'll turn it on again .",
          " Hi Jack , I'm working on these documents . The manager wants them for half an hour .",
          " Is there something you need ?",
          " Yes , I have nothing to do .",
          " I beg your pardon ?",
          " Really ? well , ok , you're welcome .",
          " Hmm , how about seven ? I can treat you to dinner .",
          " OK.Then I'll be expecting you .",
          " Thank you Dick . Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King . Tell me Dave , what is your impression of this film ?",
          " I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable .",
          " Well , that ' s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ' s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ' s just too cliche .",
          " You have always been so soft , Dave !",
          " Anyway ... That ' s all for today folks ! Join us next time as we talk about & quot , How to lose a guy in <MASK> & quot , I ' m sure you ' ll love that one Dave !",
          " Hi , Debbie . Have a seat . How's it going ?",
          " Pretty good . Listen ... have you heard about the new Thai restaurant over on University Avenue ?",
          " That's the one . A bunch of us are going there for dinner tomorrow night.How about coming with us ?",

          " See you at seven fifteen , Saturday .",
          " Sure . What is it ?",
          " I'm glad to help you . But what is it you want to ask about ?",
          " Why ? I think the meeting went well .",
          " Yes . But what are you worried about ?",
          " Rude ? You weren't rude at all , Annie . Why do you think you were rude ?",
          " I understand . But really you weren't rude at all.You said what you thought . I think he appreciates that .",
          " Yes .",
          " You mean because you are a woman ?",
          " Listen , Annie . You shouldn't worry about Mr . Drummond.He is a very good man to work for . He is not sexist at all.He appreciates people for their ideas.And he is willing to take suggestions from men or women .",
          " I agree with you on that , Annie . I've worked for Derek Drummond for <MASK> now . I feel he appreciates his employees for their work , not their gender . I would never change jobs .",
          " Any time . If you have a good idea , don't be afraid to speak up.This is a company that appreciates initiative .",
          " Uh , yes .",

          " Whoa , whoa , take it easy , relax . Geez , you ' re sweating like a pig ! What ' s going on ?",
          " What are you talking about ? It wasn ' t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family !",
          " Let ' s think this through . First of all , you cannot leave Amy at the altar . Not only will she be humiliated and kill you , but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? Second of all , you are just getting cold feet . You know deep down inside that you want to marry her , so cut the crap and do it !",
          " Great ! Phew ! That was a close one ! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you .",
          " On 20th May 1963 .",

          " You can see it tomorrow .",
          " See you .",
          " yeah , I quit my job , and started working from home . Recently I've got a project to deal with and don't have much time to work out .",
          " it's not about pay raise or promotion . You know , I hate getting up early in the morning and coming back home late at night .",
          " yeah , as long as I have a computer and internet access , I can start working . I recently enjoy working in my own place and at my own pace .",

          " thank you for reminding me . I'll continue to exercise as soon as I finish this project .",
          " of course I'd come . I couldn't think of a better chance to see all my old friends .",
          " how time flies . But hey , how are things going with you ?",
          " yeah , Jenny and I got married right after graduation . It was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . I was supporting us both while she continued her studies . But now things are getting better",
          " definitely ! Actually , we just moved into a new place . There's a house-warming party this Saturday , if you are free ? I know Jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party .",
          " It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for <MASK> .",
          " I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day .",
          " I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter .",
          " yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , <MASK> is a red-letter day .",
          " yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ...",
          " almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive .",
          " yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet .",
          " that's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ' t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .",
          " thank you .",
          " What happened ? We're all expecting you , Hans , Dick , Archie ...",
          " I see . Where are you now , Li ?",
          " It's not far away from home , It's - let me see \u2013 about 20 minutes'walk , Can you walk here ?",
          " That's too bad , But don't worry.We ' ll put off dinner till <MASK> .",

          " sure , thanks . I brought you a bottle of wine as well .",

          " this is a very nice place . How long have you been living here now ?",
          " sure , what do you have ?",
          " I'll have a glass of red wine please .",
          " so how many people are coming for the dinner tonight ?",
          " oh , I thought there were going to be eight . who isn't coming ?",
          " that's too bad.They ' re such good company .",

          " I've absolutely certain .",
          " I'm not quite positive . I think I went out at about half pass nine .",
          " No , I didn't .",
          " Quite sure .",
          " it was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring !",
          " because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there .",
          " that was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ?",
          " oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .",
          " no , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces !",
          " we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .",
          " of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though .",
          " Yes , but I ' m afraid it ' s still a mess . I haven ' t put anything away yet .",
          " Don ' t say that . It looks like a dump now . I can ' t stand it .",
          " Unfortunately , yes .",
          " I took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station . It took me <MASK> .",
          " I thought paying a lower rent would be better , but now I ' m not sure .",
          " Yes , if you consider 7-11 is a supermarket .",
          " That ' s right , or I ' m going to spend a lot of time walking .",
          " great . My family came to visit me .",
          " my immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me .",
          " I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ?",
          " interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ?",
          " do you get along well with each other ?",
          " you are very lucky to have such a nice family .",
          " I think it is easy . I could work in your class with no problem .",
          " Oh , without doubt.When is the next class ?",
          " No problem .",
          " Of course , easy.No sweat .",
          " Are you kidding me ? It's going to be up a piece of cake .",
          " Yeah , what't the bet ?",
          " really ? Where did you hear that ?",
          " I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked .",
          " that's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her .",
          " well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's pet after having the best sales record for <MASK> in a row . It definitely won't be Michael .",
          " well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost b",
          " When is the last time you talked to you parents ?",
          " Are you going to see them soon ?",
          " OK . And who are you more like , your mother or your father ?",
          " I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today .",
          " not really . After a <MASK> flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu .",
          " could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ?",
          " ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting .",
          " I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing .",
          " just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .",
          " shouldn't we make an appointment first ?",
          " whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting !",
          " My goodness ! It ' s the afternoon ? Doesn ' t the time fly ! Do come in and sit down .",
          " What ' s the time ? My watch has stopped .",
          " When do you have lunch ?",
          " What do you normally eat ?",
          " Oh , it ' s time to have lunch now .",
          " that depends . What is it ?",
          " I'd love to help you out , but I'm a bit short on cash this month as well . I had to get a new engine put into my car , and that ate up my savings .",
          " let's see , I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend . I can only spare about $ 20 . I would give you more if I had it , I just don't have much money to my name right now .",
          " that'd be great . Thanks ! What time should I come over ?",
          " see you then !",

          " at first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes , I'll post my pictures on my blog so my family an",
          " it's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks .",
          " sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like .",
          " sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality .",
          " to begin with , I have to use chopsticks .",
          " certainly . After all , I've been here for <MASK> . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Ch",
          " anything strang about that ?",
          " oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks .",
          " Q-Duck ? Do you mean the famous roast-duck store ?",
          " They have moved to some other places long time ago .",
          " Yeah , a lot of changes have happened here .",
          " Yeah , they are my wife's heaven , but not mine . I always get lost in the supermarket .",
          " Is that better now ?",
          " I ' m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ' s very fast for a kid his age .",
          " He ' s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ' s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ' s fine for someone hi",
          " The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in <MASK> .",
          " They ' re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ' s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ' re not very fast , but that ' s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .",
          " I ' d be afraid to jump from that height !",

          " Come on . Don't be so hard on yourself . Enjoy your life .",
          " It's only <MASK> into the game , too early to cheer up .",
          " Who knows ! It's a long game . Look ! That was a really nice shot !",
          " Wait , that guy , I know him . He is just a bench warmer .",

          " I usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn . I try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city .",

          " Oh , I see . I think <MASK> is more than enough time .",
          " And what did the program say ?",
          " I think that many physicians 8 now agree with that idea .",
          " And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over <MASK> , and he lifts weights every day .",
          " Yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ?",
          " Hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world .",
          " Yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies !",
          " Are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short voice ?",

          " It depends.But usually it's <MASK> .",
          " Yes , dumpling is a must.There is also other food.For example , people eat chicken for good luck .",
          " Yes , it's really wonderful !",
          " I'm sure you'll have a good time .",
          " Yes , I have a very special one . I will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for <MASK> . A friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . I was very interested . So I asked him to get me the application form . Lucky , my application was approved by the manager very soon .",
          " I will help to prepare food , feed animals and clean up . I ' m very excited about it now .",

          " Of course not ! We built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . We went sliding on the nice hill . It was a real work out . At noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . Fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . You must come with us next time . I bet you will love it .",
          " We are practically full up , but I will see . What do you want , a single room or a double one ?",

So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day . Of course , I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports , although she didn't specifically ask me to . Without her support and encouragement , I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time . But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change .

          " It is very easy . Just turn right when you leave and then turn right again at the first crossroads . The entrance to the Underground station is about 50 meters further on .",

I estimate it will probably take 3 guys <MASK> to finish , that will be an increase on your labor fee by at least 10 % ... if you need the numbers that urgently , I can have them do it .

My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used .",
          " Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input .",
          " There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort .",
          " I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done .",
          " My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more .",
          " I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her <MASK> , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day .",
          " My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner .",
          " First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first .

          " You won't have to wait a second , sir .",
          " oh , yes . I want to check whether you still have any vacancies . I need three single rooms for next Monday .",
          " yes , please . Do you take credit cards ?",
          " and how about Internet access ?",
          " is it available in the rooms ?",
          " that's OK . Is breakfast included ?",
          " fantastic . Thank you very much .",
          " I need some info on car loans . Such as payment periods , interest rates , things like that , please .",
          " Yes , I do . I have a Current Account , a credit card and a mortgage with you already .",
          " I plan to repay it within 2 years . And the interest ?",
          " So the rate is variable ? OK , that's fine . How about the frequency of repayment ?",
          " That's nice and easy . Thanks for your time .",
          " Here is my passport . And this is the declaration form .",

          " Just my cameras , my clothes , and some books .",
          " No .",
          " Alright .",
          " I ' m calling to cancel my reservation for Trans Pacific Flight 8 on July 19 from Taipei to Minneapolis . Could you please make it for the same flight on August 2 instead of July 19 ?",
          " My name is Judy Wang .",
          " My first name is J-U-D-Y , and my last name is W-A-N-G .",

          " No , thanks . I ' m all set . Good-bye .",
          " We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for <MASK> .",
          " I ' m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere .",
          " But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ' s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries .",
          " There ' s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ' s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price .",
          " Pleased to see you , too , Mr . Brown .",
          " Yes , a very pleasant journey , thank you .",
          " So it is , I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years .",
          " I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products .",
          " Thank you .",
          " That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ?",
          " No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts .",
          " I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged .",
          " No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction .",
          " Yes , we've already prepared one . I've brought it with me . I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow .",
          " Good .",
          " We've been looking forward to your visit . It is a great pleasure for us to have you as our guest . It is always more convenient to discuss things face to face .",
          " We've received some similar comments from other Australian firms too .",
          " We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers . As you know , the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial . However , according to our records , the total amount of your order last year was moderate , which does not warrant an agency appointment . Unless you increase the turnover we can hardly appoint you our sole agent .",
          " As far as I remember , we sold about 40,000 pairs last year to you alone . Don't you think this annual turnover is rather conserve - time for a sole agent ?",
          " Let's put it this way . I propose a sole agency agreement for Ladies and gents plastic slippers ( excluding children's ) for a duration of <MASK> ; 60,000 pairs to be sold in the first year , 70,000 pairs in the second year , and 80,000 pairs in the third year , the area is to be within the continent of Australia ( excluding any neighboring island ) , commission 5 % .",
          " On the contrary , Mr . London , we value your friendship more than anything else . We both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price . And with the sole agency in your hand , there will be no competition and you can easily control the market , which would naturally result in bigger sales . I'm sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty .",
          " Tomorrow afternoon .",
          " Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June ?",
          " Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ?",
          " Very well , Mrs.Wang . I'll not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer . And I'll arrange for the Letter of Credit to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home .",
          " Early next week . In the meantime , I should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . I hope that the goods can dispatched promptly after you get my Letter of Credit .",
          " That'll be fine . I appreciate your cooperation .",
          " By the way , Mrs . Wang , we have a mind to do joint participation with you on Japanese arts and crafts in our market . Would you entertain this proposal ?",
          " If you feel our proposal is attractive , it is estimated that business to the extent of over twenty million marks can be done in this manner .",
          " All right . Anyway , I'll be staying here for <MASK> . But I'm looking forward to having something done in this respect .",
          " Yes . I'd like to make a plane reservation to Shanghai , China .",
          " Via Kiang . I'd like to leave on May 5th .",
          " Well , I need an economy ticket .",
          " Single . What's the fare , PLS ?",
          " I see . Is my ticket confirmed then ?",
          " Thank you .",
          " I don't think we can .",
          " By the middle of October , I think .",
          " I understand .",
          " But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter . In fact , many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in <MASK> .",
          " I see your point . However , we have done more business this year than any of the previous years . I am very sorry to say that we cannot advance the time of delivery .",
          " You may take it from me that the last thing we want to do is to disappoint an old customer like you . But the fact remains that our manufacturers have a heavy backlog on their hands .",
          " All right . We'll get in touch with our producers and see what they have to say .",
          " So I am .",
          " I got it last week .",
          " It's valid for <MASK> . I am planning to do a doctor ' s degree during my stay there .",
          " Thank you very much .",
          " Yes . Is there anything I can do for you ?",
          " The deadline is normally no more than 5 years with the interest adopted according to the corresponding lending rates announced by the PBC .",
          " Well , the yearly interest rate is 5.49 % for <MASK> . I'm sure you are qualified to apply for this loan .",
          " You may choose a repayment pattern by consulting with our bank , for example , payment of equal amount of principal or of principal and interest on monthly installments .",
          " Exactly . You are permitted to effect and early payment in part or in full with the consent of our bank .",
          " You're welcome .",
          " This is room 1019 . I would like to order breakfast .",
          " One orange juice , scrambled eggs with bacon , toast and coffee .",
          " Yes , it is . Oh , by the way , could you also bring me today's paper ?",
          " Yes . You could use five or six units.But five or six wouldn't be very efficient . I recommend seven .",
          " Let me calculate the price for you . I can give you a 15 % discount if you buy the seven units.Let ' s see here . Your total would be 5929 dollars .",
          " As I said , it is possible , but it would be much more expensive . I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system .",
          " It's more practical , and the new units really are very quiet.Your customers won't even notice them .",
          " Yes , that's for the units.Installation would probably be another 700 to 1000 dollars.But it depends on the time spent , of course .",
          " No , Ma'am . Installation isn't included.The price I quoted was just for the units .",
          " I know that , Ma'am . But they would just raise the price of the units to cover their costs.Here in L . A . , installation is charged separately .",
          " I understand , Ma'am .",
          " It's a question of quality , Ma'am . At that price , you would not get good equipment . I've been in this business for almost twenty years . I know what happens.If you don't get quality air conditioning now , you will just have to replace the system after <MASK> .",
          " Well .",
          " Well , we don't usually do it , but ... I believe we can accommodate you on this.We will do the installation for free . Because we appreciate your business .",

When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was <MASK> . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds .

From time to time I ' ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing .

          " No . For me right now , the important thing is spoken Chinese . I need practice . So you could tutor me in speaking.We could use my textbook , and you could ask me questions.Then you could correct my mistakes .",
          " Well , today is Monday.Actually , for me Monday at this time would be the best . I am free from now until 11",
          " So if you want to meet at 10",
          " And I will bring my textbook and a tape recorder . I would like to record some things so I can practice on my own .",

          " It was great . I had a really good time .",
          " Well , I had English from <MASK> , art from 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock , and math from 2 o'clock to 4 o'clock .",
          " To be honest , I liked all of them , except for the math teacher . Though he must be quite young , he seem like an old person . He ' s so boring !",
          " She was great . In today ' s class , she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student . She told us not to arm for exams , and to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing .",
          " She said that she ' s from a small town in the middle of America .",
          " Not everything , but nearly . She speaks very clearly and doesn ' t use very complex words so that it is easy for us to understand her .",
          " Yes ... with flying colors !",
          " It ' s a new phrase that she taught us today . It means that I will not only pass the class , but I will do extremely well !",

          " It's OK . Thank you .",
          " Yes . I gotta review all of them for the final exam . It is just around the corner .",
          " That depends . Some semesters have many , some don't . And some courses don't have exams but only ask for papers . That's easy .",
          " Honestly speaking , most students prepare it <MASK> before the exam .",
          " Of course , it's useful . And it's very crucial to have the copies of teacher's notes , because most questions in the exam are based on them .",
          " But the exam is not as simple as you may imagine . We have to stay up late .",
          " Yes , some people even pack up his bed quilt and sleep there . That's a little bit crazy .",

Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under <MASK> . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ' ll put my hair up , butoften times I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ' s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine .",

          " I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He's still a millionaire .",

          " Midnight is zero and when you put the minutes in , make sure that you show them with a dot followed by the minutes . Do you understand ?",
          " It's easy , just write in the hours , total it , sign it , and put it in the box .",
          " Try it and if you can't do it , one of us can always help you later .",

          " What else ?",
          " Sounds pretty good . What about the charge ?",
          " Maybe one month . Just have a try first . Not too tough at the beginning .",
          " You can expect to earn sixty-five thousand dollars per year .",

          " Yeah , they all received very strict training . A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice .",

          " I would like to cash my undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate , please .",

          " Really ? I have been told , by another bank , that it makes it difficult if you want to investigate a company which is registered outside China .",

          " No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it !",
          " Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ?",
          " Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me .",

          " Definitely . I want to get my mortgage paid off as soon as I can .",
          " Mmmm ... that does sound interesting . Is there anyone available I can talk with about this in more detail ?",
          " Yes , fine . I had something wrong with my stomach . I won ' t go into detail , but it wasn ' t serious .",
          " I think most people are a little nervous about it . I was really very , very nervous just before I had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation .",
          " Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ' t permitted to eat anything for <MASK> . That was the worse thing .",
          " I certainly was ! However , the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn ' t eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list !",
          " No , not at all . I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days .",
          " Oh , yes . The nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what I could drink . In the end , I just drank water and nothing else . Everyone was very professional and I actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay .",
          " I'm going to be studying overseas next year and I'd like some info about suitable loans . To be honest , I'm not even sure if I can get a loan .",
          " Would I have to get my parents to guarantor the loan ?",
          " I see . What about age limitations ?",
          " Got it ! I fit into that category very nicely . That's great ! I'll have a chat with my parents and come back . Thanks very much .",
          " That's right . Here you go .",
          " OK , as I expected . How much will you allow me to borrow ? I mean , I don't need a massive sum of money .",
          " That'll be enough , and the repayment period sounds good to me .",
          " How soon before this goes through ?",
          " Perfect . So , I guess my next job is to go to the newsagent and buy some car magazines . Thanks for everything .",
          " I don't know . I just know I've never been asked so many questions in my life .",
          " Three-but there was one of them who kept asking really stupid questions .",
          " Oh , he wanted to know what time I got up this morning and if I bad a bath or a shower you know , things like that .",
          " I've no idea . Oh yes , and the most ridiculous thing . He asked me what I had for breakfast this morning .",
          " Hmm . Thank you very much .",

          " it's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it .",
          " no , but we do have to pay <MASK> rent in 6 months , so for the first months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month .",
          " no , it's all included . Besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here .",
          " that's the bad thing---the contract ends in June , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon .",

          " there's an opening in the creative design department . It involves working with computers .",
          " Yes , that ' s right . To be honest , the first year was quite tough for me . I was really just treated more like an intern . I didn ' t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating .",
          " Well slowly but surely I proved myself , and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .",
          " Yes , I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . I spent 3 years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ' t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term .",
          " I just felt that the paper couldn ' t offer me any new opportunities . I really needed a more challenging role to be honest .",
          " The annual salary is sixty-five thousand dollars per year .",
          " This job pays for half of your medical , dental , and disability .",
          " You have a total of <MASK> paid time off which can be used for vacation , personal , or sick leave .",

          " I think I'll go for the smallest , as it's just for documents . Will I be the only key holder ? I'd perhaps feel a little nervous if I knew someone else could have access to it at any time .",
          " That's great ; I can give an extra key to my wife . I feel perfectly comfortable with her having a key . Thanks for your help .",
          " OK , I'll take a small , for 1 year , in this branch , please .",
          " Hello , I called earlier regarding interest rates on loans . Sorry , I just have a couple more questions .",
          " What if I require a loan for a short period of time ?",
          " Say , <MASK> ? Or less in fact . I want to repay the loan ASAP ; I don't like debt hanging over my head .",
          " What if I repay it early . Any perks ?",
          " So , the quicker I pay it back , the more I can save in interest ? That's excellent . Thanks so much for your information . I'll come in shortly to take the relevant steps for the loan .",
          " I need some info on car loans . Such as payment periods , interest rates , things like that , please .",
          " Yes , I do . I have a Current Account , a credit card and a mortgage with you already .",
          " I plan to repay it within <MASK> . And the interest ?",
          " So the rate is variable ? OK , that's fine . How about the frequency of repayment ?",
          " That's nice and easy . Thanks for your time .",
          " Hello , I'd like to talk to someone about making a withdrawal .",
          " Yes , but the problem is that I have a Savings Account with you , and I need to take some money from that . Do I really have to give <MASK> notice if I want my money ?",
          " That's not a problem . I'll pop in later today to make a formal request . Thanks !",
          " I spoke to a girl named Claire on the phone ; it's about losing my card and everything .",
          " So , I can get my new card today ?",
          " 7 days ! What am I supposed to do for money until then ?",
          " I was told to come over to this window if I want to make a withdrawal . I'm not withdrawing from a Current Account , you see . I want to withdraw from my Certificate of Deposit .",
          " Oh , I see . Will I lose any money if I decide to withdraw on it now ?",
          " Oh dear . Well , if it has to be done , then it has to be done .",
          " No , Nancy , today I'm here to make a withdrawal . I made a formal request <MASK> .",
          " That's correct . But before I do , I was wondering if you could give me some advice .",
          " Maybe I'm making a big mistake cashing in my Time Deposit before maturity .",
          " No , not really . My Current Account is for cash flow and couldn't withstand having all of that money taken from it .",
          " I want to save some US dollars into my account .",
          " Yes , that's what my husband advised me to do . But I'm not sure how long I should save for .",
          " Mmmm ... 2 years does seem like a long time . How about the interest if I save for <MASK> ?",
          " That sounds fine to me . Yes , I think 6 months is the way to go .",
          " I want to save some US dollars into my account .",

          " That sounds fine to me . Yes , I think 6 months is the way to go .",
          " Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ?",
          " Is there any flexibility on that ?",
          " OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan .",
          " Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ?",
          " Is there any flexibility on that ?",
          " OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan .",

          " That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ?",
          " No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts .",
          " I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged .",
          " No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction .",
          " Yes , we've already prepared one . I've brought it with me . I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow .",
          " Good .",
          " Great ! I'd love to get a little better discount than 6 % , but if your company provides the insurance , that will save us a few bucks ...",
          " No ... We shouldn't have any problem with that . I know we talked about a possibility for 90 days , but we won't be needing that after your discounted price .",
          " Great !",
          " Let's get start . What kinds of things do you have in mind ? If you let us know the requirements you have from the very beginning , we can work through each one until we can come to an agreement .",
          " Huh ... I think 7 % is little high that might be hard to do . How about this ? We'll give you a discount of 4 % , but you can have <MASK> credits .",
          " No , you have to take care of the insurance . But we are willing to pay the half transport . Can you accept that ?",
          " But you'll have 90 days to pay your bill and I'll tell you what ... I'll also throw in the discount of 10 % on your up front deposit .",

          " Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June ?",
          " Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ?",
          " Very well , Mrs.Wang . I'll not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer . And I'll arrange for the Letter of Credit to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home .",
          " Early next week . In the meantime , I should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . I hope that the goods can dispatched promptly after you get my Letter of Credit .",
          " That'll be fine . I appreciate your cooperation .",
          " By the way , Mrs . Wang , we have a mind to do joint participation with you on Japanese arts and crafts in our market . Would you entertain this proposal ?",
          " If you feel our proposal is attractive , it is estimated that business to the extent of over twenty million marks can be done in this manner .",
          " All right . Anyway , I'll be staying here for another two weeks . But I'm looking forward to having something done in this respect .",
          " I don't think we can .",
          " By the middle of October , I think .",
          " I understand .",
          " But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter . In fact , many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter .",
          " I see your point . However , we have done more business this year than any of the previous years . I am very sorry to say that we cannot advance the time of delivery .",
          " You may take it from me that the last thing we want to do is to disappoint an old customer like you . But the fact remains that our manufacturers have a heavy backlog on their hands .",
          " All right . We'll get in touch with our producers and see what they have to say .",
          " Yes . Is there anything I can do for you ?",
          " The deadline is normally no more than 5 years with the interest adopted according to the corresponding lending rates announced by the PBC .",
          " Well , the yearly interest rate is 5.49 % for 3 years . I'm sure you are qualified to apply for this loan .",
          " You may choose a repayment pattern by consulting with our bank , for example , payment of equal amount of principal or of principal and interest on monthly installments .",
          " Exactly . You are permitted to effect and early payment in part or in full with the consent of our bank .",
          " You're welcome .",
          " Yes . Is there anything I can do for you ?",
          " The deadline is normally <MASK> with the interest adopted according to the corresponding lending rates announced by the PBC .",
          " Well , the yearly interest rate is 5.49 % for 3 years . I'm sure you are qualified to apply for this loan .",
          " You may choose a repayment pattern by consulting with our bank , for example , payment of equal amount of principal or of principal and interest on monthly installments .",
          " Exactly . You are permitted to effect and early payment in part or in full with the consent of our bank .",
          " You're welcome .",
          " Yes . You could use five or six units.But five or six wouldn't be very efficient . I recommend seven .",
          " Let me calculate the price for you . I can give you a 15 % discount if you buy the seven units.Let ' s see here . Your total would be 5929 dollars .",
          " As I said , it is possible , but it would be much more expensive . I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system .",
          " It's more practical , and the new units really are very quiet.Your customers won't even notice them .",
          " Yes , that's for the units.Installation would probably be another 700 to 1000 dollars.But it depends on the time spent , of course .",
          " No , Ma'am . Installation isn't included.The price I quoted was just for the units .",
          " I know that , Ma'am . But they would just raise the price of the units to cover their costs.Here in L . A . , installation is charged separately .",
          " I understand , Ma'am .",
          " It's a question of quality , Ma'am . At that price , you would not get good equipment . I've been in this business for almost <MASK> . I know what happens.If you don't get quality air conditioning now , you will just have to replace the system after two years .",
          " Well .",
          " Well , we don't usually do it , but ... I believe we can accommodate you on this.We will do the installation for free . Because we appreciate your business .",
          " What ?",
          " Yes . We need some . How much did you change ?",
          " Yes , it's about 35 pesos for every Taiwan dollar , right ?",
          " What do you mean ?",
          " Why ?",
          " Sixty ? That's too much . How can that be ?",
          " Just <MASK> it was 35 . How can it be 60 ?",
          " That's amazing ! Really ? How could it change so much in two days ?",
          " Yes . I've read it carefully .",
          " No . But the contract stipulates that I will teach 22 hours a week.Will you have thatmany classes for me right away ?",
          " But my salary will be 1100 dollars a month.Will you pay me that much for the first month ? Because , I mean , I won't be working so many hours .",
          " Oh , so I don't sign the contract today . Is that right ?",
          " I can accept that .",
          " Even my health insurance ?",
          " I have a few questions about the free membership .",
          " Is my membership the same as paying club members ? I mean , can I get discounts at club hotels ?",
          " What are bar vouchers ?",
          " But according to the contract , employees get a discount in the restaurant .",
          " So , for now , you want me to keep a copy of the contract.But we won't sign it yet . That right ?",
          " I understand.And according to the terms on the contract , I am happy to accept this job . I look forward to it .",
          " Yes . I've read it carefully .",
          " No . But the contract stipulates that I will teach 22 hours a week.Will you have thatmany classes for me right away ?",
